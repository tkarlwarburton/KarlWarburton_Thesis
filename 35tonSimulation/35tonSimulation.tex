\section{Determination of interaction times} \label{sec:SimInteractionTimes} %Section - X.1
As outlined at the end of Section~\ref{sec:LArSoft} it is important to know the interaction time of a track when performing calorimetric reconstruction. When performing simulations the simplest interaction time to assign to a reconstructed object is the Monte Carlo truth time of when the particle was created. The generation time can be used, as the time taken to travel the distances considered in simulations, less than 100 ns, is small when compared to the resolution of the detector (500 ns). When matching a reconstructed object with a GEANT4 particle the particle which contributed the most overall deposited charge to the whole track is chosen. This means that the energy deposited for each hit on the track is broken down into how much each particle contributed to the charge of the individual hit, with the energies summed over all hits. The ability to assign the true interaction times to 3D objects is vital when wanting to benchmark how well other algorithms to estimate interaction times perform or to determine the efficiency of the tracking algorithms as described in Section~\ref{sec:SimRecoEffic}. \\

In the 35 ton detector, it was envisioned that there would be at least two ways in which interaction times could be assigned to tracks, one using the external cosmic ray counters and another using reconstructed scintillation light collected by the photon detectors. The cosmic ray counters were used extensively in the 35 ton data, as described in Section~\ref{sec:DataAlgs}. However, in simulations the scintillation light was used as this would have been more powerful during continuous running. This is because, not all particles would pass through the counters but, one wold expect almost all of them to produce reconstructable scintillation light. The flashes of light are reconstructed using a pre-built library which models the expected number of photoelectrons to be measured on each photon detector given the 3D position of the source of the flash. Using the library it is then possible to reconstruct the location of a flash in three dimensions, given the relative amounts of light that each photon detector collects. For example, less scintillation light will be collected for a flash that originated further away from the photon detectors. This library also takes into account the expected quantum efficiencies of each photon detector. \\

When trying to produce an association metric a sample of 10,000 isolated positive muons generated with CRY at $T$ = 0 was used. Isolated particles were used as then there should only be one long track with which to match one reconstructed flash. The positive muons were generated outside of the detector with a constant $y$ position, above the uppermost scintillation counters, and flat distributions in $x$ and $z$. When this sample was simulated it was clear that the photon detector reconstruction using the pre-built libraries worked well as the reconstructed flash source normally lay very close to the track which caused it. It was found that a Point of Closest Approach (PoCA) calculation of the reconstructed track to the reconstructed flash centre, gave an effective metric by which the flash and track could be associated. Other metrics such as the distance between the flash and track centres, and the perpendicular distance between the flash centre and the line joining the start and end of track were investigated but found to provide less reliable metrics. The latter of these metrics is less effective because the reconstructed tracks are rarely straight lines, due to particles scattering as they travel through the LAr, and so the perpendicular distance at each hit must be calculated. A comparison of these metrics is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:PDYZDist}. \\

The point of closest approach between the flash centre and all hits along the track is shown in red.}
  \label{fig:PDYZDist}
\end{figure}

Another metric by which flashes could be assigned to reconstructed tracks is by utilising the relationship between the number of measured photoelectrons in the simulation, and the distance from the APAs at which they were produced. When considering two flashes of scintillation light that are produced at different distances from the APAs, it would be expected that more photoelectrons would be collected when the photons were produced closer to the APAs. This relationship is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:PD_PExPlot} where it can be seen that there is an exponential decay in the number of photoelectrons which are measured with increasing drift distances. Utilising this relationship, means that the distance from the APAs can be predicted from the number of photoelectrons which are measured. This predicted distance from the APA planes can then be compared to the expected $x$ position of a reconstructed track given the difference in flash time and hit times, this is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:PD_PEDiffX}. The difference in these two quantities can then be used as the second metric as it gives an indication of how well the properties of a flash match the reconstructed $x$ position of the track. If the predicted and reconstructed $x$ positions are identical then the track and flash are well matched, this corresponds to the collection of points around the $y=x$ line in Figure~\ref{fig:PD_PEDiffX}. \\

  \label{fig:PD_PEDiffX}
\end{figure}

Using these metrics it is possible to attempt to assign reconstructed flashes to reconstructed tracks. Only flashes which are within one drift window of a given track are considered, as flashes outside of this time window cannot have been caused by the reconstructed track. Once flashes are assigned to tracks it is possible to determine how well the matching has performed by comparing the Monte Carlo truth interaction time with the photon detector interaction time. When doing this it is more useful to use a CRY sample which spans multiple drift windows, as then incoming particles will create scintillation flashes at random timings as opposed to all at $T$ = 0 in the positive muon sample initially considered. The CRY sample over multiple windows contains many particles generated by CRY, and is not limited to only producing positive muons, meaning that it better represents the cosmic flux observed by the 35 ton detector. This comparison is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:PD_MCPDDiff}, where there is a clear peak at a time difference of 0 ms in the Monte Carlo truth and photon detector times. When zooming in on this peak it can be seen that there is a systematic offset of 0.6 $\mu$s, this is due to an electronics offset applied in the simulation to the photon detector system. \\

          \label{fig:PD_MCPDDiff}
\end{figure}

From Figure~\ref{fig:PD_MCPDDiff} it can clearly be seen that the metric using the proximity of the flash centre to the track trajectory yields the best matches. This is likely caused by the large spread in the number of photoelectrons collected at fixed drift distances, as shown by Figure~\ref{fig:PD_PExPlot}. The two metrics can be combined to give a prediction for the interaction time, though given the increased sensitivity from the proximity metric this should be given greater weighting. In physics data the metric using the number of collected photoelectrons is particularly sensitive to the absolute light level in the detector as a high residual light level would reduce the proportional change in the number of photoelectrons collected for increasing drift distances. This metric also relies a sample of tracks with known $x$ positions upon which it can be calibrated which may be difficult to obtain. \\

\section{Calibrating calorimetric constants} \label{sec:MCCalib} %Section - X.2
Having the correct calorimetric responses is vital when trying to calculate $\frac{dE}{dx}$ as the measured change in charge has to be correctly converted to the change in energy. The parameter which has to be tuned in order to ensure that this is done correctly is the number of electrons that each ADC corresponds to. This was presented in Equations~\ref{eq:Birks} and ~\ref{eq:ModBox} as $C_{ADC \rightarrow e^{-}}$. Each plane will have a different response function, and so each plane has to be treated separately. These parameters have to be tuned in such a way as to make a known particle energy deposition have the correct $\frac{dE}{dx}$, the easiest deposition to tune against is the minimally ionising particle (MIP) peak, which in LAr should have a value of 1.8 MeV cm$^{-1}$. To do this the sample of 10,000 positive muons made to calibrate the photon detector track/flash assignment will be used as many of these particles will be MIPs. \\

To select the MIPs in the sample only tracks caused by through-going muons are used. The $\frac{dE}{dx}$ value for all hits in all tracks is then calculated, and the different planes are considered separately. A Gaussian distribution is then fitted around the peaks for each of the planes to discern the most probable value (MPV) of $\frac{dE}{dx}$ for that plane. If the MPVs are not equal to 1.8 MeV cm$^{-1}$ then the ADC to electron parameters are scaled by the factor between the measured MPV and the MIP peak. As the relationship between $\frac{dE}{dx}$ and $C_{ADC \rightarrow e^{-}}$ is not linear an element of trial and error is required until the correct MPVs are measured. An example of the calibration being applied is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:CaloTune}. Calibration of the response functions is required whenever the electronics gains or signal shaping functions are changed.

\section{Discerning reconstruction efficiencies} \label{sec:SimRecoEffic} %Section - X.3
Knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses of different tracking algorithms is vital when using them for physics analyses. To this end it is useful to develop a metric by which they can be compared. In order to do this a series of conditions have to be applied to the reconstructed tracks from a large set of simulated particles which are reconstructed using different tracking algorithms. It is interesting to observe what the effect of event complexity has on the reconstruction algorithms and so efficiencies will be calculated for both of the CRY samples used in Section~\ref{sec:SimInteractionTimes}. The sample referred to as the positive muon sample contains single positive muons generated at $T$ = 0, with a constant $y$ position above the scintillation panels, and flat distributions in $x$ and $z$. The sample refereed to as the CRY sample, contains multiple particles of multiple particle types, generated at times spanning multiple drift windows, and at an altitude above sea level of 0 m. \\

The criteria upon which to determine whether a particle is well reconstructed has to be carefully chosen as every definition will have limitations. For example, consider a particle that travels 100 cm in the active volume of the detector but is reconstructed as 2 separate tracks (tracks 1 and 2), with lengths 77 cm and 23 cm respectively. Firstly, should these tracks be merged, or left separate? If the reconstruction algorithms have found them to be separate tracks then it is likely that it would be difficult to ascertain that they are from the same particle in real data, and so in considerations here they are not merged. One metric of efficiency would be to consider a track well reconstructed if it has a length between 75$\%$ and 125$\%$ of the Monte Carlo truth length that the particle traversed in the detector, in which case track 1 would be considered well reconstructed. Another metric however would be to consider a track well reconstructed if the Monte Carlo truth distance the particle traversed in the detector is between 75$\%$ and 125$\%$ of the reconstructed length, in which case neither track would be considered well matched. Both metrics have used exactly the same tracks and a seemingly identical method of evaluating whether a track is well reconstructed or not, but have got the opposite results. As such it is wrong to say which consideration gives the correct result, but instead the result of each should be considered equally. It should also be noted that these are just two of a wide range of definitions one could use to quantify a well reconstructed track. In discussions here the former definition of efficiency will be used, such that a track is considered well reconstructed if:
\begin{itemize}
\item Reconstructed track length is more than or equal to 75$\%$ of the Monte Carlo track length.
\item Reconstructed track length is less than or equal to 125$\%$ of the Monte Carlo track length.
\item Only one reconstructed track can be matched per Monte Carlo particle.
\end{itemize}

When calculating efficiencies it is important to consider much more than just the ratio of reconstructed to true track length. To this end efficiencies with regards to many aspects of the tracks are calculated:
\begin{itemize}
\item Track length,
\item Energy deposited in the active volume of the detector,
\item The angle $\theta$ of the track, defined as the angle that a vector makes from the $x$ axis in the $xy$ plane,
\item The angle $\phi$ of the track, defined as the angle between the $z$ axis and the vector.
\end{itemize}
In all efficiency plots the Monte Carlo truth quantity, not the reconstructed quantity is shown so as to reflect how the variations of these quantities affect the reconstruction efficiencies. It is also useful to observe the effect on reconstruction of failed disambiguation and incorrect interaction time determination. To show this, two forms of reconstruction are ran on the particles. One reconstruction path uses no Monte Carlo information and so the interaction time is determined using the simulated photon detectors as described in Section~\ref{sec:SimInteractionTimes}. The second reconstruction path uses cheated disambiguation and interaction time determination. Cheated disambiguation means using the Monte Carlo truth information of the energy deposition to correctly assign which wire segment the energy was deposited on. \\

The calculation of reconstruction efficiencies also serves as an effective method upon which reconstruction algorithms can be further developed as it identifies aspects which do not work as expected. For example when the efficiencies for the CRY sample were initially calculated they were significantly lower than for the positive muon sample, but only when disambiguation was not cheated. It transpired that this was because the disambiguation was only selecting the largest collection of hits on each plane for each TPC. This is not a problem when only 1 particle is simulated and will reduce the number of noise hits but in a CRY sample of 16 ms there will almost certainly be multiple particles in each TPC. Removing the hits from all but one of these multiple particles will cause them to have no reconstructed track, and thus cause the efficiency to drop significantly. Upon making the disambiguation algorithm no longer have this restriction the reconstruction efficiencies of the positive muon and CRY samples were observed to become much more similar. \\

The reconstruction efficiencies given the current state of the most commonly used reconstruction algorithms are shown in Figures~\ref{fig:SimEffic_Length},~\ref{fig:SimEffic_EnDepos},~\ref{fig:SimEffic_Theta},~\ref{fig:SimEffic_Phi} and~\ref{fig:SimEffic_ThetaPhi}. Efficiencies are shown for both the positive muon and CRY samples, where it can be seen that the efficiency tends to be lower for the CRY sample. It is thought that this is due to the more complex event structure in the CRY sample, as multiple primary particles will be present in the detector at any given time. The relatively slow drift velocity of LAr may mean that these tracks cross in wire-tick space. Tracks crossing in wire-tick space could cause reconstruction errors as the overlaps may be mistaken for interactions, which would cause the tracks to be split, resulting in the interaction time calculated from the photon detectors to be incorrect. This error, in the calculation of interaction time using the photon detectors, was seen in Figure~\ref{fig:PD_MCPDDiff}. The reconstruction efficiencies for the CRY sample are more realistic as events will rarely be isolated in the detector due to the large flux of cosmic particles on the Earth's surface. \\

\end{figure}

A striking feature of Figure~\ref{fig:SimEffic_Length} is the rapid decrease in reconstructed efficiency for the CRY sample for track lengths above 250 cm when using Pandora. The cause of this is that tracks are reconstructed separately in the long and short drift volumes before being merged when they are found to be co-linear in the $yz$ plane. This is not a problem in the positive muon sample as the $x$ position of the hits calculated using Equation~\ref{eq:HitTime} will be correct. Where, $x_{Hit}$ is the calculated $x$ position of the hit, $T_{Hit}$ is the measured time of the hit, and $v_{Drift}$ is the electron drift velocity. An electron, in an electric field of 500 V cm$^{-1}$, in LAr, drifts at a speed of 0.160563 cm $\mu$s$^{-1}$.
\begin{equation}
   \label{eq:HitTime}
   x_{Hit} = T_{Hit} \times v_{Drift}
\end{equation}
However, when the same is done for hits in the CRY sample using particles with large interaction times, the $x$ positions will have offsets proportional to the interaction time of the particle, unless the hit time is corrected
by Equation~\ref{eq:HitTime_Int}. Where $T_{Hit}$ is the corrected hit time, $T_{Measured}$ is the measured time of the hit, and $T_{Interaction}$ is the calculated interaction of the particle which caused the hit.
\begin{equation}
   \label{eq:HitTime_Int}
   T_{Hit} = T_{Measured} - T_{Interaction}
\end{equation}
This is due to particles being generated at large interaction times, as opposed to all at $T$ = 0, as in the positive muons sample. For example, if a particle is generated at a time of $T$ = 12.5 ms, then the offset in $x$ position would be more than 20 m, using Equation~\ref{eq:HitTime}. Obviously the hits could not have occurred at those positions, as the drift distances are roughly 30 cm in the 'short' drift volume, and 250 cm in the 'long' drift volume. However, if tracks which are reconstructed separately in the 'short' and 'long' drift volumes, are merged before this $x$ offset is corrected for, then the combined track length will have a discontinuity in $x$ of more than 40 m! As the interaction time of the track is calculated using the output of the tracking algorithms it is not possible to prevent this by using the interaction time at present. It is however, possible to subtract this jump in $x$ position from the track length quantity which is calculated when the stitched track is stored in the event. This will give the correct track length, though the user will still have to correct individual hit positions in later analyses, using the calculated interaction time. This is what is done by PMTrack, hence it not exhibiting this rapid decrease in reconstruction efficiency for long tracks. The interaction time can be found from, among other things, the Monte Carlo truth generation time, or the photon detectors.\\

It is clear from Figure~\ref{fig:SimEffic_Length} that particles with track lengths less than 30 cm are poorly reconstructed. The very low efficiency for particles with track lengths less than 10 cm can be partially attributed to, Monte Carlo truth particles with track lengths of less than 1 cm, in the active volume of the detector. These particles, which represent ~30\% of the particles with active volume track lengths of less than 10 cm, are too short to be reconstructed using the current reconstruction process. These particles will need to be reconstructed when looking for supernovae bursts, though special algorithms will be written to do this, as the traditional hit finding and clustering algorithms may discard them due to the isolated nature of the hits. Another issue is that the low energies of these particles may mean that the signals that they produce are below threshold and so will not even be reconstructed, or if hits are reconstructed, they may be too close to a more energetic track, and get absorbed into them. The reconstruction of tracks is affected by the number of wires which they cross, though this should not matter for particles with lengths of more than 5 cm in the active volume, as they will have crossed roughly 10 wires in each plane, which should produce enough unique hits for a cluster to be reliably constructed. This can be seen to be the case for PMTrack when considering the positive muon sample, as the efficiency for particle track lengths between 10 and 20 cm is roughly the same as that for track lengths between 20 and 30 cm, however when considering the CRY sample there is still a significant decrease in efficiency. This is attributed to secondary particles which are produced in hadronic interactions with the concrete surrounding the detector. Many of these particles will travel only very short distances in the active volume, though those that travel slightly larger distances are likely to cause energy depositions that will be confined to the detector edges. The tracking algorithms may struggle to accurately reconstruct these tracks, as significant portions of the track will be close to the detector edge, where the field is poorly modelled and hits may be more difficult to disambiguate. \\

The trend of increasing efficiency for longer track lengths from Figure~\ref{fig:SimEffic_Length} can also be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:SimEffic_EnDepos} as the amount of deposited energy increases. This is because particles which deposit more energy will tend to have travelled further in the detector. The amount of energy that particles deposit is limited by the size of the detector, as particles with an energy of more than 1 GeV are energetic enough to be MIPS. This results in few particles depositing more than 1 GeV in the detector. The result of this is that the uncertainty in the reconstruction efficiency increases above 1 GeV. The larger range in the amount of energy deposited seen in Figure~\ref{fig:SimEffic_EnDepos_CRY}, is due to the larger number of muons in the CRY that create large electromagnetic showers upon entering the LAr. \\

It is also interesting to note the pronounced decreases in reconstruction efficiencies for particular angles, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:SimEffic_Theta} and Figure~\ref{fig:SimEffic_Phi}. The decrease in efficiency at $\phi = \frac{\pi}{2}$ can be attributed to the drop in efficiency for particles with track lengths between 190 cm and 200 cm. This is because the vertical height of the detector is approximately 195 cm, and near vertical tracks will hit few collection wires, meaning that determining the triple points needed by the disambiguation is very difficult. This is verified by the large increase in efficiency achieved by cheating the disambiguation, as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:SimEffic_Theta_AMu}, where the reduction in reconstruction efficiency is seen to become much less pronounced. Similarly the decrease in efficiency at $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}$ can be attributed to particles which are perpendicular to the collection wires resulting in few collection wires being hit. \\  

The information from Figures~\ref{fig:SimEffic_Theta} and~\ref{fig:SimEffic_Phi} is combined in Figure~\ref{fig:SimEffic_ThetaPhi}, where the sharp drop in efficiency at $\phi = \frac{\pi}{2}$ for the 'non-cheated' CRY sample, is particularly visible. The effect of cheated disambiguation is clear in Figure~\ref{fig:SimEffic_ThetaPhi_CRY} where the dip in efficiency as a function of $\theta$ at fixed $\phi=\frac{\pi}{2}$ is completely removed. The same is not true however, for the dip in efficiency as a function $\phi$ at fixed $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}$, though the reduction in efficiency was not as severe as that seen for fixed values of $\phi = \frac{\pi}{2}$. The effect of 'cheated disambiguation' can still be seen though, as the reconstruction efficiency in Figure~\ref{fig:SimEffic_ThetaPhi_CRY} can be seen to improve for values of $\phi$. There are still however, noticeable decreases in the reconstruction efficiency for values of $\phi$ close to 0 or $\pi$, when using Pandora. The improvement in the performance of the reconstruction algorithms that comes from 'cheating' the reconstruction is part of the motivation for the wire pitches in the DUNE FD being 36$^{\circ}$ as opposed to the 45$\pm$0.7$^{\circ}$ used in the 35 ton. This is because, as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:LArSoft}, the shallower wire pitch makes disambiguation easier. Though disambiguation will be easier in the different geometry, further efforts to improve disambiguation are still required, as are continued efforts to reconstruct the shortest tracks. \\

\section{Performing particle identification}  \label{sec:PID} %Section - X.4
Being able to perform reliable particle identification (PID) is a key requirement for the DUNE experiment, and so efforts have been made to establish a procedure by which this can be achieved. The predominant method of performing PID in LAr is to use the relationship between $\frac{dE}{dx}$ and the residual range of the track, defined as being the distance between a point on the track and the stopping point of the track. This relationship is observed to be dependent on particle mass and is quantified by the Bethe-Bloch equation~\citep{Bethe}~\citep{Bloch} which is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:BetheBloch} and presented in Equation~\ref{eq:Bethe-Bloch}. \\

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Bethe-Bloch}
  \caption[The mean energy loss per unit track length of different particle masses in different materials]
          {The mean energy loss per unit track length of different particle masses in different materials~\citep{PDGReview}. The $\frac{Z}{A}$ of Liquid Argon is slightly less than that of Carbon.}
  \label{fig:BetheBloch}
\end{figure}

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:Bethe-Bloch}
  -\frac{dE}{dx} = K z^2 \frac{Z}{A} \varrho \frac{1}{\beta^2} \left[ \frac{1}{2} \ln{\frac{2 m_e c^2 \beta^2 \gamma^2 T_{max}}{I^2}} - \beta^2 - \frac{\delta(\beta\gamma)}{2}\right]
\end{equation}

The sharp increase in energy loss per unit length can be seen to occur at different momenta for different particle masses meaning that the peak value of $\frac{dE}{dx}$ can change significantly. When comparing muons and protons, it can be seen that the momenta at which the $\frac{dE}{dx}$ increases is very different. When muons and pions are compared, it can be seen that the momenta at which an increase occurs is very similar. \\

The particle mass dependence can be seen by plotting the $\frac{dE}{dx}$ against the residual range of the particle on a log-log plot, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:PIDA_loglog}. A power law dependence is found to describe the relationship~\citep{PIDA_Paper}, as shown in Equation~\ref{eq:PIDA}.
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:PIDA}
  \frac{dE}{dx} = A R^b
\end{equation}
The dependence on $b$ is found to be weak, and so can be set to -0.42 for all particle masses. This means that the main discriminant used is the $A$ parameter, which has a strong dependence on particle mass. The values for $A$ and $b$ calculated from Figure~\ref{fig:PIDA_loglog} are shown in Table~\ref{tab:PIDAVals}. It is found that the error introduced by fixing the $b$ parameter is small compared to the error from ionisation fluctuations. \\

\begin{table}

\begin{tabular}{l c c}

Proton   & 17 & -0.42 \\

Deuteron & 25 & -0.43 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Once the $b$ parameter is set to be constant for all particle types it is possible to calculate a value for the $A$ parameter for each hit on the track using Equation~\ref{eq:PIDA_A}, where $R_i$ is the residual range of the track at that point.
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:PIDA_A}
  A_i = \left(\frac{dE}{dx}\right)_i \times \left(R_{i}\right)^{0.42}
\end{equation}
The particle type discriminant, called PIDA, can then be calculated for a track by finding the average value of $A_i$ for the track. As the particle mass dependant increase in $\frac{dE}{dx}$ only occurs near the end of the track, the PIDA variable can only be calculated for particles which stop in the detector as all other particles will have MIP-like $\frac{dE}{dx}$ distributions and so cannot be identified in this way. As shown by the plotted range of Figure~\ref{fig:PIDA_loglog} the average value of $A$ is normally calculated for the last 30 cm of the track. \\

          {Stopping power for different particle masses as a function of residual range in liquid Argon. The figure is taken from~\citep{PIDA_Paper}.}
  \label{fig:PIDA_loglog}
\end{figure}

The PIDA method was tested in~\citep{PIDA_Paper}, where the PIDA values were calculated for simulated particles which stopped in the detector, using truth information over the last 30 cm of the particle tracks. This is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:PIDA_MC}, where a clear separation can be seen between the peaks for muons, pions, kaons and protons. Though the muon and pion peaks are relatively close together they can still be resolved in the plot due to little overlap. It is interesting to note how tight the PIDA distributions found in the paper are, which allows the different particles types to cleanly separated in the truth study. The author notes that an incorrect tuning of the electron recombination effects will cause the distributions in Figure~\ref{fig:PIDA_MC} to become broader. The dependence of $\frac{dE}{dx}$ on the recombination effects ($Recomb_{X}$) were presented in Equations~\ref{eq:Birks} and~\ref{eq:ModBox}. The author also notes that an incorrect calibration of the detector will introduce a systematic shift in the expected values of PIDA, this is why the work presented in Section~\ref{sec:MCCalib} is important. \\

\end{figure}

From Figure~\ref{fig:PIDA_MC} it can be seen that the most distinct PIDA distributions are that of muons and protons, these are also two of the most common particle types in cosmic rays. For these reasons particle identification using the PIDA variable will be attempted on simulations of the 35 ton. As outlined in Sections~\ref{sec:SimInteractionTimes} and ~\ref{sec:MCCalib} in order to do this the interaction times of particles have to be well known and the calibration constants must be tuned so as to ensure that the effects of recombination are properly accounted for. It is also useful to use the information found in Section~\ref{sec:SimRecoEffic} about the efficiency with which tracks are reconstructed. In this regard it is useful to produce additional figures showing the reconstruction efficiencies of protons in the CRY sample, these are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Prot_Effic}.\\

  \label{fig:Prot_Effic}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:Prot_Effic} shows that the average reconstruction efficiency for PMTrack is higher than that for Pandora when considering protons. This can be easily seen in Figure~\ref{fig:Prot_Effic_Theta} where the efficiency for PMTrack is roughly 10\% higher than that for Pandora, for all values of $\theta$. The reconstruction efficiency is still much lower than the overall efficiency shown in Figure~\ref{fig:SimEffic_Theta}, for both the positive muon and CRY samples though. This shows that the overall reconstruction efficiency for protons is quite low. Comparing Figures~\ref{fig:SimEffic_Length_CRY} and~\ref{fig:Prot_Effic_Len}, it is evident that the reconstruction efficiency for protons with track lengths of more than 10 cm is reasonably similar, to that of the overall reconstruction efficiency for the CRY sample, when using PMTrack. However, the reconstruction efficiency is significantly lower for protons with tracks of less than 10 cm. When using Pandora to reconstruct protons, the reconstruction efficiency is lower for all track lengths. It is found that 60\% of simulated protons have track lengths of less than 1 cm, and that none of these particles are reconstructed. It is this large number of very short particles which causes the overall reconstruction efficiency to be relatively low. When particles with track lengths of less than 1 cm (10 cm) are removed, the average reconstruction efficiency for PMTrack rises to 37\% (58\%). This shows that, when the shortest tracks are not counted the reconstruction performs reasonably well. \\

It is also useful to produce samples where the primary particle is a single muon or proton located in the active volume of the detector. This allows for a sample of isolated tracks to be made upon which the capabilities of the PIDA metric can be tested. It also allows the reconstruction efficiency to be found for particles in isolation. The properties of the generated particles are illustrated below in Table~\ref{tab:IsolProp}. The values of the simulated quantities were found by changing the given parameters by an amount taken from a random sampling of a Gaussian distribution of width equal to the error listed. These simulation parameters were chosen to produce samples which would contain both exiting and stopping particles whilst generating the particles in the LAr would ensure that there should always be a reconstructable track in the detector. The reconstruction efficiencies when using the PMTrack reconstruction method are shown for the simulated particles in Figure~\ref{fig:Isol_Effic}. \\


Particles with track lengths of less than 1 cm have been excluded from these plots which is why the angular reconstruction efficiencies for protons in Figures~\ref{fig:Isol_Effic_Theta} and~\ref{fig:Isol_Effic_Phi}, are higher than those seen in Figures~\ref{fig:Prot_Effic_Theta} and~\ref{fig:Prot_Effic_Phi}. This was done as none of these particles were reconstructed due to the very short distances which they travel. After discounting these very short particles, the efficiencies generally follow similar patterns observed in the earlier efficiency plots, though there is a decrease in efficiencies for the longest track lengths which is not observed in other samples. This is attributed to the initial positions of the particles being within the detector volume, as this means that any particle travelling over 100 cm would have a very peculiar trajectory as the edge of the detector should never be more than 100 cm away from the starting position. The only exception to this is if a particle travelled along the $x$ axis to the other end of the detector, which, as discussed earlier, is a very problematic orientation to reconstruct as all of the charge would be deposited over a large range of time on very few collection plane wires. \\

\end{figure}

As the increase in $\frac{dE}{dx}$ is only visible when the particle stops in the detector it is necessary to remove exiting particles from the sample by applying a fiducial cut on the end point of the reconstructed track. It is important to only place this on the end point of the track, as one does not want to remove particles which enter the detector and then stop. When calorimetry is performed, the end point of the track is determined using, among other metrics, the increase in $\frac{dE}{dx}$ and so the residual range of the track (a stored data member of the track object), should always refer to the distance to the end of the particles trajectory. For this study a fiducial cut of 5 cm is used, meaning that any track with hits within 5 cm of the edge of the detector volume is discarded, and counted as an exiting particle. This should mean that very few tracks due to exiting particles are identified as stopping in the detector, as it would require the reconstruction algorithms to miss large section of the track. This will mean that some stopping particles are incorrectly assigned as exiting particles, causing the identification efficiency to drop, but it is necessary to ensure that exiting particles are not included in the final distributions. A further cut that is applied, is the requirement that there are a minimum of 5 collection plane hits, this is to ensure that an adequate number of points are taken upon which to find an average value of PIDA for the track. Similar cuts are described in~\citep{PIDA_Paper}, and the resulting distributions of PIDA values for the single proton and muon samples are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Isol_PIDA}. \\

  \label{fig:Isol_PIDA}
\end{figure}

As can be seen from Figure~\ref{fig:Isol_PIDA} using truth information can make the distributions much cleaner, particularly when discounting particles for which the reconstruction algorithms do not track to their end point. A track is identified as having a correct end point if the reconstructed end point is within 2.5 cm of the true end point of the particle. It is reassuring to see that few tracks are reconstructed backwards, as if this were not the case then performing particle identification would be very difficult, as it would indicate that the calorimetry and tracking algorithms are not performing well. Improvements can still be made though, as both plots in Figure~\ref{fig:Isol_PIDA} contain tracks which do not have the final energy depositions. This can be seen as when the requirement that the reconstructed track end point is consistent with the true end point, the low tails of the PIDA distributions are significantly reduced. This is most noticeably the case in Figure~\ref{fig:Isol_PIDA_Proton}, where the peak at low values of PIDA is significantly reduced. It is observed that the PIDA distributions are cleaner when information from all three wire planes are used, as opposed to only using the collection plane, and so this is presented here. This shows how important it is to calibrate the electronics responses of all three wire planes, and how additional wire planes can improve calorimetry, as well as the accuracy of reconstruction algorithms. \\

The relationship between the $\frac{dE}{dx}$ and residual range of a track is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Isol_dEdx} for both protons and muons. The much steeper increase in $\frac{dE}{dx}$ at low residual range for protons compared to muons is clearly visible when comparing Figures~\ref{fig:Isol_dEdx_Proton} and~\ref{fig:Isol_dEdx_Muon}. The contamination in the proton sample at low PIDA can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:Isol_dEdx_Proton} where there is a clear sample of tracks for which the $\frac{dE}{dx}$ does not increase for low residual ranges. These plots are filled after tracks whose end points do not correlate with the true end points, are removed, and so the tail of low $\frac{dE}{dx}$ values is due to particles for which the simulated detector did not find increased energy depositions as the particle stopped. It is therefore possible that at least some of these protons do not in fact stop, but interact inelastically when they still have a significant amount of kinetic energy meaning that GEANT4 will create a new particle and that the tracking algorithms are creating a new track after this interaction. \\

It is useful to summarise the information shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Isol_PIDA} in a table so that an efficiency of identifying stopping particles can be found. This is shown in Table~\ref{tab:Isol_PIDA_Proton} for protons, and in Table~\ref{tab:Isol_PIDA_Muon} for muons. The efficiency shown in these tables is defined as the number of tracks in the PIDA range, divided by the total number of stopping particles. This means that, should more reconstructed tracks have PIDA values within the PIDA range than there are stopping particles, then the efficiency can be more than 100\%. This is the case in Table~\ref{tab:Isol_PIDA_Muon}. The purity shown in these tables is defined as the percentage of tracks in the PIDA range, which are associated with particles that stop in the detector. As many of the tracks shown in the 'reconstructed tracks' row in Table~\ref{tab:Isol_PIDA_Muon}, are not due to stopping particles the purity is low, but this increases markedly after the fiducial cut is applied. The PIDA ranges referred to are 14-18 and 5-9 for protons and muons respectively, as these ranges cover the peaks of the distributions shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Isol_dEdx}, and are centred on the peaks in Figure~\ref{fig:PIDA_MC}. \\

As can be seen in Table~\ref{tab:Isol_PIDA_Proton}, the efficiency upon which protons can be identified does not change significantly as the sequential criteria are applied, but, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Isol_PIDA_Proton}, the peak at low values of PIDA decreases significantly. The same cannot be said for the muon sample however, as when the criteria that the tracking end point matches the true end point is applied, a significant section of the tail within the PIDA range is removed which significantly reduces the PIDA efficiency. However, the resulting distribution is more similar to that shown in Figure~\ref{fig:PIDA_MC}, showing that the particles which survive the cut are those that are very well reconstructed. The cut to remove tracks that do not have the correct end points reduces both sets of efficiencies, but, if all particles were reconstructed with the correct end points, then one can imagine that the number of tracks within the PIDA ranges would increase, and the distributions would become more symmetrical, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Isol_PIDA_Muon}. Both tables also exhibit high purities, which shows that the fiducial cut designed to removing exiting particles is effective, with only 2 exiting protons being mis-identified in the proton sample. \\

From Table~\ref{tab:Isol_PIDA_Proton} it can be seen that there are more stopping protons than primary protons, as only 10,000 primary protons were generated. The effectiveness of the PIDA algorithm at identifying only primary protons is shown in Table~\ref{tab:Isol_PIDA_PrimProton}. Comparing both tables, it can be seen that the efficiency with which the primary protons can be identified, is larger than the secondary protons, as the efficiencies shown in Table~\ref{tab:Isol_PIDA_Proton} are lower than those in Table~\ref{tab:Isol_PIDA_PrimProton}. It is thought that this is due to the low reconstruction efficiency for particles with the shortest track lengths, as many of the secondary protons will have, as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:SimRecoEffic}. A similar table is not produced for primary muons as there were no secondary muons produced in the muon sample, and so Table~\ref{tab:Isol_PIDA_Muon} is itself the efficiency with which the primary muons can be identified. \\

Upon verifying that the PIDA metric can reliably determine particle type when they are simulated in isolation, the next step is to observe the accuracy upon which particles can be identified in a CRY sample. The sample used here differs from the CRY sample used earlier in that only events which contain a proton in the detector are reconstructed. This is done to reduce simulation time and storage space, as this cut will still provide a substantial number of muons, whilst ensuring that a large proton sample can be reconstructed. The process of calculating PIDA values for tracks is identical in all samples, though as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:SimRecoEffic} the much more complicated event structure in the CRY sample affects the reconstruction efficiency, and so will likely also affect the accuracy of the calorimetry. The calorimetry will be affected in two ways, firstly, the reduced performance of the reconstruction algorithms will mean that some particles are not reconstructed at all, whilst those that are reconstructed may be more likely to have missing hits, and so the end points may be reconstructed less accurately. This will cause the tail of low $\frac{dE}{dx}$ values, seen in Figure~\ref{fig:Isol_dEdx_Proton}, to be more pronounced. Secondly, though the photon detector time determination is very accurate for a large number of tracks it is also incorrect for a number of tracks, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:PD_MCPDDiff}. This will cause the recombination correction to be miscalculated, which will in turn increase the calculated $\frac{dE}{dx}$, and hence PIDA values. \\

The PIDA values calculated for protons and muons in the CRY sample are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:CRY_PIDA}. As can be seen from Figure~\ref{fig:CRY_PIDA_Muon}, there is a tail of very high PIDA value muon tracks which contaminate the proton PIDA region of interest (ROI). This causes a serious problem when trying to identify protons from a cosmic sample, as the muon flux is significantly higher than the number of protons. The result of this will be a sample of tracks which will not be very pure, and so further cuts will have to be developed to enhance the purity of this sample whilst not reducing the efficiency upon which proton tracks are identified. \\
