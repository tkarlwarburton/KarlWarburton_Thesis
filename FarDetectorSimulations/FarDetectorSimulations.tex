Previous work presented has been done concerning the 35 ton prototype, however it is also important to simulate the DUNE Far Detector (FD). Simulations in the FD have concentrated on cosmogenic background to neutrino oscillations, in Section~\ref{sec:LBNESurf}, and the muon background to nucleon decay, in Section~\ref{sec:DUNENDK}. The simulations shown in Section~\ref{sec:LBNESurf} are discussed in!!!!~citep{MartinsThesis}!!!!, and were performed for the Long Baseline Neutrino Experiment (LBNE), which along with the Long Baseline Neutrino Oscillation (LBNO) experiment, formed the basis for DUNE, and so are included here for completeness. The other work presented was performed for the DUNE collaboration, in conjunction with work done by Vitaly Kudryavtsev and Matthew Robinson, both of the University of Sheffield. This work was performed with the aim of producing muon-induced background limits to nucleon decay in the DUNE FD. \\

\section{The use of MUSUN in LArSoft} \label{sec:FDIncorporation}  %Section - X.3
The primary muons in the following discussions are all generated using MUSIC~\citep{MUSUN}~\citep{MUSIC}~\citep{MUSIC2} and MUSUN~\citep{MUSUN}~\citep{MUSUN2}, and so a brief overview of them is required. MUSIC first propagates muons through a medium, defined by the user, for given initial energies, positions, and direction cosines. A range of energies between 10$^2$ and 10$^7$ GeV are considered, and their energy distributions are stored at depths of between 100 and 15,000 m w.e. Energy losses due to four processes are considered; ionisation, bremsstrahlung, electron-positron pair production and muon-nucleus inelastic scattering. The output of MUSIC is then used by MUSUN to generate a muon energy spectrum and angular distribution, for a given detector location. MUSUN is able to use information about the local surface profile to make these distributions more accurate. \\

The location of the DUNE far detector, near the Ross shaft at SURF, has global coordinates of, 44$^{\circ|}$20$'$45.21$''$ North, 103$^{\circ}$45$'$16.13$''$ West. The rock composition is assumed to be, $< Z >$ = 12.09 and $< A >$ = 24.17. The density is assumed to be 2.70 g cm${-3}$~\citep{Mei:2009py}. The flux calculated by MUSIC/MUSUN of 5.18 $\times$ 10$^{-9}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$, is well matched to the flux measured by the active veto system of the Davis' experiment, which was (5.38 $\pm$ 0.07) $\times$ 10$^{-9}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$~\citep{PhysRevD.27.1444}. Given the small differences in these values, and another measurement by the Majorana demonstrator, the systematic uncertainty in calculating the muon flux is estimated to be 20\%~\citep{NDKTFNote}. \\

The surface profile around the proposed detector location is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:SurfProf_Col}, where the proposed location is in the centre of the map. Each quadrant on the map has been divided into 4 angles of 22$^{\circ}$, to help guide the eye when comparing it to Figure~\ref{fig:SurfProf_Azi}, where the distribution of azimuth angles is plotted. The vertical lines in Figure~\ref{fig:SurfProf_Azi} show the division of the quadrants when the angle is calculated from East to the North. When moving from East to North it is possible to discern how the peaks and troughs on the surface profile, correspond to troughs and peaks, in the distribution of azimuthal angle. \\

Given these parameters, the muon flux at the DUNE far detector location, when assuming a spherical detector geometry, and without simulating a detector cavern, is given by Table~\ref{tab:MUSUNflux}. \\

The muons simulated for DUNE are sampled on the surface of a box surrounding the detector hall, that also encompasses 7 m of rock above the cavern, and 5 m of rock on all other sides. This is to ensure that the simulated muons pass through a sufficient amount of rock to induce cascades, both above and around the detector hall. The secondaries produced in these cascades which enter the detector, in the absence of the initial muon, are of particular interest, as they could be mistaken for nucelon decay events. The study of these nucelon decay mimicking events is discussed in Section~\ref{sec:DUNENDK}. The size of the box which the muons are sampled from is 74.43 $\times$ 29.54 $\times$ 30.18 m$^3$, compared to the simulated cryostat which has dimensions, 61.62 $\times$ 14.94 $\times$ 13.58 m$^3$. The dimensions are given as length $\times$ width $\times$ height. The muons are sampled randomly according to their energy spectrum, for a given zenith and azimuthal angle, using the angular distribution obtained with MUSIC. \\

Before this could be done however, MUSUN had to be incorporated into the DUNE software framework, as it had previously been maintained in FORTRAN as an external package. This involved building on the work done by the LZ collaboration in porting the code to C++~!!!!!citep{Kareem}. The process by which this was done, was to first reproduce the distributions produced by the LZ collaboration using the DUNE software framework. Once the distributions could be reproduced for the Davis shaft at SURF, the muon distributions produced by the original FORTRAN code for the DUNE detector location were reproduced. The distributions produced by the DUNE software framework are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:MUSUNIncorp}. These are seen to be consistent with the distributions made for the LBNE collaboration~\citep{MUSUNLBNE}. The initial positions of 10,000 muons generated in LArSoft around the simulated DUNE 10 kt module are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:10ktPos}. The initial positions of the muons are shown as blue points, whilst the cryostat is a single black box, and each TPC is a single red box. \\

It is found that the muon rate through the box upon which the muons are sampled is 0.1579 Hz. This rate is later used to normalise the background event rate in Section~\ref{sec:DUNENDK}. Roughly a third of the muons which are generated pass through the active volume, to give a muon rate through the active volume of 0.053 Hz. \\ 

%********************************** % Fifth Section  *************************************
\section{Nucleon decay channels in DUNE} \label{sec:DUNENDK} %Section - X.5
When searching for rare processes, where an experiment is unlikely to see more than a few real signatures, an exhaustive study of the potential backgrounds is required. This is so that if a signal is observed, it could provide overwhelming evidence for the process. The search for nucleon decay in DUNE is one such process, and so an exhaustive study of the background to nucleon decay is required. As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:BkNDK}, cosmogenic muons cause backgrounds to nucleon decay signatures, as the secondary particles produced by their interactions are able to mimic the nucleon decay signatures. For this reason it is necessary to simulate this background, and to develop a series of cuts which can be applied to the energy depositions they produce, to establish that they are not due to nucleon decays. When doing this, it is important to use a simulation that is as accurate as possible to the DUNE far detector. It is for this reason that MUSUN was incorporated into LArSoft, as the muons which it generates are well matched to the observed muon flux, as described in Section~\ref{sec:FDIncorporation}. \\

To ensure that the background has been properly simulated it is advantageous to simulate many more background events than will be collected by the experiment. As the DUNE detector will run for roughly 20 years, it was decided that an initial sample representing 200 years of detector live time would be simulated. Given that the muon rate through the cavern is 0.1579 Hz, 200 years of detector live time corresponds to roughly 10$^9$ muons. This only represents one of the DUNE 10 kt modules, and so an even larger dataset will be required to represent the full live time of the 4 10 kt modules. For this reason, muons will continue to be generated beyond this initial sample size. \\

Producing samples of this size requires significant computer power, both in terms of running time, and storage space. As such, many of the simulated events are discarded before being saved to disk, through the application of a filter after GEANT4. It is essential that the events which are discarded could not have been mistaken for nucleon decay events, and so only very generous cuts are applied. Only events satisfying one of the following cuts are discarded;
\begin{itemize}
\item Contain a muon track of more than 1 m.
\item There are no energy depositions in the entire detector volume.
\end{itemize}
It is envisioned that a muon track of more than a metre would not be misreconstructed. It is also assumed that any signatures observed within one drift window of such a track would not be studied in a nucleon decay search, as there would be doubt as to the authenticity of the signal. Given that the total rate of muons through the active volume is 0.053 Hz, and that the drift time is a few ms, ignoring all times where any track from a cosmogenic muon is present results in less than 0.1\% dead time. The dead time associated with ignoring events with muon tracks of more than 1 m is clearly less than this. This amount of dead time is assumed to be acceptable. \\

After applying this series of cuts, the initial sample of 10$^9$ muons is reduced to XXXX$\times$10$^{XXXX}$ muons, which is a much more reasonable sample size to store on tape, and to perform analyses on. It is upon this reduced sample of muons that the cosmogenic background analyses are performed. As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:NDK_Atmos}, the proton decay channel of $p \rightarrow K^{+} + \nu^{e}$ is referred to as the 'Golden Channel' in LAr, this analysis is discussed in~\citep{NDKTFNote}. The related decay of channel of $n \rightarrow K^{+} + e^{-}$ is discussed here. \\

%********************************** % Fifth.First Section  *************************************
\subsection{Cosmogenic background to the $n \rightarrow K^{+} + e^{-}$ decay channel} \label{sec:NDKCosmBk}
As shown in Table~\ref{tab:NDKLim}, the predicted sensitivity that DUNE will have to this channel is much larger than that of Super-K. As a result, it is an interesting decay mode to study as DUNE could easily have the best limit for this decay channel. As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:BkNDK}, the cosmogenic background to nucleon decay is predominantly caused by neutral particles, such as $K^0$, entering the detector volume, and interacting far away from the detector edges. This is particularly true for the 'Golden Channel,' as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:K0LongBackground}, but it also holds for other channels. This means that it is events such as this which are the main cause for concern when trying to eliminate all cosmogenic backgrounds. \\

As is the case with the 'Golden Channel,' the final state of the decay contains a single charged kaon, and so events which do not contain a kaon track can be immediately discounted. There is also an electron in the final state of the decay, and so this means that events which do not also contain an electron can be discounted. In a nucleon decay event, the kaon and electron produced in the final state will have a common vertex, and so the requirement that the two particles have a common vertex can also be applied. Other constraints that are applied to eliminate background events are; a cut on external muon length, a cut on depositions near the detector edges, and criteria about the distribution of deposited energy. The criteria about the distribution of deposited energy is found by considering a sample of simulated decay events, and is discussed in Section~\ref{sec:NDKSig}. These cuts, which are applied sequentially, are outlined below:
\begin{itemize}
\item The event contains energy depositions due to kaons and due to electrons.
\item The event contains at least one kaon track, and at least one electron track/shower.
\item The event contains a single kaon track, and a single electron track/shower.
\item No muon travels more than 20 cm in the detector volume.
\item The event has no energy depositions within 2 cm of the detector edges.
\item The kaon and electron share a common vertex.
\item The energy depositions in the event are within the ranges expected from a nucleon decay event. This is explained in Section~\ref{sec:NDKSig}, but the energies considered are summarised below:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The energy directly deposited by the kaon.
  \item The energy deposited by the kaon decay products.
  \item The energy directly deposited by the electron.
  \item The energy deposited near the shared kaon and electron vertex
  \item The energy deposited in the detector which does not fit any of the above criteria.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Inspiration for these cuts were taken from~\citep{Bueno}, though some of the cuts were relaxed. The cut on muons was relaxed from a cut on any muon being present, to a maximum track length of 20 cm, as this was found to be sufficient. The cuts on the number of pions in the event were relaxed so as to not expect that all particles are perfectly reconstructed. However, as the analysis is performed using Monte Carlo truth information, without position or energy smearing, the kaons and electrons are assumed to be perfectly reconstructed. This means that it is assumed that all deposited charge will be reconstructed, and that the detector characterisation is perfect. This is something which will need to be refined in future analyses, and will be taken into account when the analysis progresses to use reconstructed quantities, as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:NDKImprov}. \\ 

When performing the analysis it is important to be able to trace the particle ancestory. This is so that energy depositions in the detector can be properly assigned, and cuts applied, to the relevant particles. For example, a $\mu^{+}$ is often produced when a $K^{+}$ decays at rest, and this muon may travel more than 20 cm. However, the cut on muon length should not be applied to this muon as it was produced by the decay of the kaon. Similarily, as the kaon interacts in the detector secondary particles will be produced, which will be reconstructed as tracks coming off the main kaon track. The initial kinetic energy of the kaon can then be determined by summing the energy depositions due to these secondary particles, and the energy depositions due to the kaon itself. Correctly calculating the initial kaon kinetic energy is critical when determining if an event is a nucleon decay event. The reason for this is that nucelon decay events have very specfic energy criteria, and so being able to correctly assign the ancestory of energy depositions is vitally important. The same is true for the electron energy, which is calculated by tracing the ancestory of the particles in the shower back to the particle which initiated the shower.\\

As no reconstruction has been performed, the tracks referred to here are different from those in previous sections. The definition of a track used here, is that the particle in question has energy depositions on simulated wires which are directly associated with it. These simulated wires, are not the same as the the wires which have been considered in previous Monte Carlo studies, as the signals have not been digitized. This distinction is important, as it allows the energy depositions directly from GEANT4 to be used, whilst also allowing for LArSoft methods concerning whether depositions are within TPC boundaries to be utilised. \\

Requiring particles to deposit energy on simulated wires in order for them to be considered a track, places the requirement that an electron has a 'track like' segment before it begins to shower. This is an assumption which has been taken from the benchmarking of the shower reconstruction in LArSoft, and is used so that it is possible to calculate the positions at which particles begin and finish depositing energy in the detector. The distance between the start of the kaon and electron tracks, can then be calculated as the distance between the initial position of the kaon, and the initial position of the electron. These points generally correspond to the Monte Carlo truth start positions, though this is not always the case, as it is possible that they were produced in uninstrumented regions of the detector, such as the gaps between TPCs. The fiducial cut that is applied is only applied with respect to the outer edge of the cryostat, as if it were done with respect to the edge of every TPC in the far detector the loss of volume would be prohibitive. \\

Once the ancestry of energy depositions in the simulation have been correctly accounted for, and the initial kinetic energies calculated, it is possible to observe the distribution of background events as the cuts outlined above are applied. The energy distribution of background events survivng the application of sequential cuts is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:NDK_CosmoBack_Raw}. The normalised energy distribution of background events surviving the application of sequential cuts is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:NDK_CosmoBack_Norm}. The distribution of normalised energies is found by dividing the number of events by the bin energy. \\

  \label{fig:NDK_CosmoBack_Norm}
\end{figure}

From Figures~\ref{fig:NDK_CosmoBack_Raw} and~\ref{fig:NDK_CosmoBack_Norm}, it can be seen that there are no background events which could mimic a decay signature as there no events which survive the application of all cuts. It is interesting to observe the effect that relaxing some of the cuts has on the number which events which survive previous cuts. 

%********************************** % Fifth.Second Section  *************************************
\subsection{Signal events in the $n \rightarrow K^{+} + e^{-}$ decay channel} \label{sec:NDKSig}
It is important to confirm that the cuts developed do not adversely affect the identification of a true nucleon decay event. For this reason a sample of 10,000 neutron decay events were generated using GENIE. The neutron decay events were not generated in the full 10 kt module, but were instead generated in a scaled detector, which has TPCs of the same length, height, and width as the detector used in the cosmogenic detector. However, the scaled detector has significantly less APAs, and so TPCs, this is particularly true in the case of the $z$ direction. The scaled down detector (10 kt module) has dimensions, in units of the number of TPCs, 2 (2) in the $y$ (vertical) direction, 2 (4) in the $x$ (drift) direction, and 6 (25) in the $z$ (beam) direction. As a result of the much smaller detector geometry, containment is a much more significant issue in the scaled detector than it will be in the full 10 kt detector. Neutron decays are generated randomly within the detector volume, and so it is possible that the decay occurs in an uninstrumented region of the detector. This will further compound the containment issue as it is conceivable that a simulated decay will occur outside of the volume which is encolsed by the TPCs, meaning that one or both of the particles produced in the decay would not deposit energy in the detector. \\

The analysis performed on the cosmogenic background was primarily designed to reject background events, whilst also attempting to not use cuts which would also affect signal efficiency. Therefore, it is hoped that the loss of signal events will be minimal. When running the analysis on the simulated signal events the same definitions for tracks, showers, and the ancestory of particles are used, as well as the same cuts that were outlined in Section~\ref{sec:NDKCosmBk}. Due to the smaller detector volume that is simulated, it is envisioned that there may be an artificially large loss in signal events due to the 2 cm fiducial cut which is applied. \\

The energy distribution of the signal events survivng the application of the sequential cuts is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:NDK_Sig_Raw}, this is the equivalent of Figure~\ref{fig:NDK_CosmoBack_Raw} for the cosmogenic background sample. The normalised energy distribution of signal events surviving the application of sequential cuts is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:NDK_Sig_Norm}, this is the equivalent of Figure~\ref{fig:NDK_CosmoBack_Norm} for the cosmogenic background sample. As before, the distribution of normalised energies is found by dividing the number of events by the bin energy. \\

\begin{figure}[h!]

  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{NucleonDecay_EnergyDepCuts_Raw}
  \caption[The energy distribution of signal events surviving the application of sequential cuts in the $n \rightarrow K^{+} + e^{-}$ channel]
          {The energy distribution of signal events surviving the application of sequential cuts in the $n \rightarrow K^{+} + e^{-}$ channel. The total energy deposited in the detector is plotted on the $x$ axis.}

  \label{fig:NDK_Sig_Norm}
\end{figure}

When comparing Figures~\ref{fig:NDK_Sig_Raw} and~\ref{fig:NDK_Sig_Norm} with Figures~\ref{fig:NDK_CosmoBack_Raw} and~\ref{fig:NDK_CosmoBack_Norm}, the most obvious difference is that when considering the nucleon decay events, the total energy deposited in the detector never exceeds 1 GeV, whilst in the cosmogenic background sample, the energy deposited in the detector frequently exceeds 1 GeV. This is something which one would expect, as the simulated neutrons decay at rest and so have an energy of less than 1 GeV, meaning that there cannot be more than 1 GeV deposited in the detector. This is in stark contrast with the cosmogenic background, where the primary muons being generated have a mean energy of 283 GeV, as shown in Table~\ref{tab:MUSUNflux}. This means that many events will deposit sigificant amounts of energy in the detector, even if the primary muon narrowly misses the detector volume. \\

The initial cuts, requiring that both a kaon track and an electron shower are observed in the decay, show that there are occassions when either the kaon, or the electron, do not deposit energy in the detector. It can be seen that for events when this occurs, the total energy deposited in the detector is usually below 100 MeV. This hints that at least one of the particles escaped the detector without depositing significant amounts of energy. Handscanning of events confirms this, as events for which either a kaon or an electron is not observed, have a decay vertex close to the edge of the detector volume. As discussed earlier, this is due to the random locations at which the decays occur within the LAr. When a decay occurs near the edge of the active volume, one would not expect to be able to identify both the kaon and electron produced in the decay, as particle identification relies on knowing the stopping point of the particle. Fortunately, even in this scaled detector, this happens relatively rarely, as it affects less than 2\% of the simulated decay events. \\

The requirement that the start of the kaon track, and the start of the electron shower, are within 2 cm of eachother seems to be a reasonable requirement, as almost all of the signal events satisfy this condition. The distance between the start of the kaon track, and the start of the electron shower is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:NDK_Sig_KEDist}. It can be seen that the seperation between the two particles is very small (<0.1 cm) in most events, however, there are some events where the seperations are very large (>10 cm). The very large seperations seen in some events is surprising.

\subsection{Future improvements to nucleon decay studies} \label{sec:NDKImprov}
Thus far the nucleon decay studies have been performed on the Monte Carlo truth information, and so have not used reconstructed objects such as tracks. The extension of the analyses to include work on tracks is an important next step as then the full analysis which would be applied on real data can be tested. Preliminary studies have begun on hit reconstruction, and involve running a filter on the muons used in the earlier analyses. This is because the number of events which are saved to disk would be prohibitive to running the full reconstruction process. As such, only events which meet the following criteria will be reconstructed~\citep{CosmoJanCollabMeeting};
\begin{itemize}
\item A minimum of 10 MeV deposited in the detector volume.
\item A maximum of 3,000 MeV deposited in the detector volume.
\item A maximum of 5 MeV deposited within 10 cm of the detector edge.
\end{itemize}
These criteria are designed to be broad enough that the full range of nucleon decay modes can be studied, including di-nucleon decay modes, hence the maximum deposited energy greatly exceeding the rest mass of a single nucleon. \\
