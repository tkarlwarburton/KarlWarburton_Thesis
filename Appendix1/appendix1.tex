The following figures support the figures shown in Section~\ref{sec:DiffMCStudies}.

Figures~\ref{fig:DiffNoiseStudy_HitFit},~\ref{fig:DiffNoiseStudy_CDiff4},~\ref{fig:DiffNoiseStudy_RMS0cm}, and~\ref{fig:DiffNoiseStudy_ChargeCut} correspond to changing levels of the electronics noise.

Figures~\ref{fig:DiffLifeStudy_HitFit},~\ref{fig:DiffLifeStudy_CDiff4},~\ref{fig:DiffLifeStudy_RMS0cm}, and~\ref{fig:DiffLifeStudy_ChargeCut} correspond to changing electron lifetimes.

Figures~\ref{fig:DiffElecStudy_HitFit},~\ref{fig:DiffElecStudy_CDiff4},~\ref{fig:DiffElecStudy_RMS0cm}, and~\ref{fig:DiffElecStudy_ChargeCut} correspond to changing electric fields.

Figures~\ref{fig:DiffLDiff_HitFit},~\ref{fig:DiffLDiff_CDiff4},~\ref{fig:DiffLDiff_RMS0cm}, and~\ref{fig:DiffLDiff_ChargeCut} correspond to changing constants of longitudinal diffusion. \\

Figures~\ref{fig:DiffNoiseStudy_HitFit},~\ref{fig:DiffLifeStudy_HitFit},~\ref{fig:DiffElecStudy_HitFit}, and~\ref{fig:DiffLDiff_HitFit} show how the distributions of the hit $RMS$ and hit $RMS/Charge$ change for hits between 20 and 30 cm from the APAs.

Figures~\ref{fig:DiffNoiseStudy_CDiff4},~\ref{fig:DiffLifeStudy_CDiff4},~\ref{fig:DiffElecStudy_CDiff4}, and~\ref{fig:DiffLDiff_CDiff4} show how the most probable values of hit $RMS$ changes with drift distance for tracks associated with counter differences of 4.

Figures~\ref{fig:DiffNoiseStudy_RMS0cm},~\ref{fig:DiffLifeStudy_RMS0cm},~\ref{fig:DiffElecStudy_RMS0cm}, and~\ref{fig:DiffLDiff_RMS0cm} show how the most probable value of hit $RMS$ next to the APAs changes with increasing counter difference.

Figures~\ref{fig:DiffNoiseStudy_ChargeCut},~\ref{fig:DiffLifeStudy_ChargeCut},~\ref{fig:DiffElecStudy_ChargeCut}, and~\ref{fig:DiffLDiff_ChargeCut} show the normalised hit charge distributions for increasing noise levels, and the cut which is applied to remove the tails of the distribution. \\
