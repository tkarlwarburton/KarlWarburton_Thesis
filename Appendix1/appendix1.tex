Figure~\ref{fig:DiffNoiseStudy_HitFit} shows how the distributions of the hit $RMS$ and hit $RMS/Charge$ change as the electronics noise increases, for hits between 20 and 30 cm from the APAs. Figure~\ref{fig:DiffNoiseStudy_CDiff4}, shows how the most probable values of hit $RMS$ changes with drift distance for tracks associated with counter differences of 4, for different values of the electronics noise. Figure~\ref{fig:DiffNoiseStudy_RMS0cm}, shows how the most probable value of hit $RMS$ next to the APAs changes with increasing counter difference. Figure~\ref{fig:DiffNoiseStudy_ChargeCut}, shows the normalised hit charge distributions for increasing noise levels, and the cut which is applied to remove the tails of the distribution. \\ 

Figure~\ref{fig:DiffLifeStudy_HitFit}, shows how the distributions of the hit $RMS$ and hit $RMS/Charge$ change as the electron lifetime increases, for hits between 20 and 30 cm from the APAs. Figure~\ref{fig:DiffLifeStudy_CDiff4}, shows how the most probable values of hit $RMS$ change with drift distance for tracks associated with counter differences of 4, for different values of the electron lifetime. Figure~\ref{fig:DiffLifeStudy_RMS0cm}, shows how the most probable value of hit $RMS$ next to the APAs changes with increasing counter difference. Figure~\ref{fig:DiffLifeStudy_ChargeCut}, shows the normalised hit charge distributions for increasing electron lifetimes, and the cut which is applied to remove the tails of the distribution. \\ 

Figure~\ref{fig:DiffElecStudy_HitFit}, shows how the distributions of the hit $RMS$ and hit $RMS/Charge$ change as the electric field increases, for hits between 20 and 30 cm from the APAs. Figure~\ref{fig:DiffElecStudy_CDiff4}, shows how the most probable values of hit $RMS$ changes with drift distance for tracks associated with counter differences of 4, for different values of the electric field. Figure~\ref{fig:DiffElecStudy_RMS0cm}, shows how the most probable value of hit $RMS$ next to the APAs changes with increasing counter difference. Figure~\ref{fig:DiffElecStudy_ChargeCut}, shows the normalised hit charge distributions for increasing electric fields, and the cut which is applied to remove the tails of the distribution. \\

Figure~\ref{fig:DiffLDiff_HitFit}, shows how the distributions of the hit $RMS$ and hit $RMS/Charge$ change as the constant of longitudinal diffusion increases, for hits between 20 and 30 cm from the APAs. Figure~\ref{fig:DiffLDiff_CDiff4}, shows how the most probable values of hit $RMS$ changes with drift distance for tracks associated with counter differences of 4, for different values of the constant of longitudinal diffusion. Figure~\ref{fig:DiffLDiff_RMS0cm}, shows how the most probable value of hit $RMS$ next to the APAs changes with increasing counter difference.  Figure~\ref{fig:DiffLDiff_ChargeCut}, shows the normalised hit charge distributions for increasing values of the constant of longitudinal diffusion, and the cut which is applied to remove the tails of the distribution. \\
