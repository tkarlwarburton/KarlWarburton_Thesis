%%%%%%%% The electronics noise study
Figure~\ref{fig:DiffNoiseStudy_HitFit}, shows how the most probable values of the hit $RMS$ and hit $RMS/Charge$ change as the electronics noise increases, for hits between 20 and 30 cm from the APAs. Figure~\ref{fig:DiffNoiseStudy_CDiff4}, shows how the most probable values of hit $RMS$ changes as drift distance increases for track associated with counter differences of 4, for different values of the electronics noise. Figure~\ref{fig:DiffNoiseStudy_RMS0cm}, shows how the most probable value of hit $RMS$ next to the APAs changes for increasing counter differece. Figure~\ref{fig:DiffNoiseStudy_ChargeCut}, shows the normalised hit charge distributions for increasing noise levels, and the cut which is applied to remove the tails of the distribution. \\
