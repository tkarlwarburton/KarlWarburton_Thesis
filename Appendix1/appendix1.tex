%%%%%%%% The Electron lifetime study
Figure~\ref{fig:DiffLifeStudy_HitFit}, shows how the most probable values of the hit $RMS$ and hit $RMS/Charge$ change as the electron lifetime increases, for hits between 20 and 30 cm from the APAs. Figure~\ref{fig:DiffLifeStudy_CDiff4}, shows how the most probable values of hit $RMS$ changes as drift distance increases for track associated with counter differences of 4, for different values of the electron lifetime. Figure~\ref{fig:DiffLifeStudy_RMS0cm}, shows how the most probable value of hit $RMS$ next to the APAs changes for increasing counter differece. \\

%%%%%%%% The diffusion constant study
Figure~\ref{fig:DiffLDiff_HitFit}, shows how the most probable values of the hit $RMS$ and hit $RMS/Charge$ change as the constant of longitudinal diffusion increases, for hits between 20 and 30 cm from the APAs.

Figure~\ref{fig:DiffLDiff_RMS0cm}, shows how the most probable value of hit $RMS$ next to the APAs changes for increasing counter differece. \\
