The data taking period for the 35 ton prototype was from November 2015 until March 2016. This included an extensive commissioning period before the detector was filled with LAr and the electric field was turned on. During this time many of the features of the data discussed below were first noticed and attempts to rectify these were pursued. A long commissioning period was also required because many of the DAQ sub-systems were still under active development in November.\\

A total of 22 days worth of data was collected with the electric field set at 250 V cm$^{-1}$, the breakdown of when these periods occurred is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:DataCollected}. It is clear that the analysable data is interspersed with data where the electric field was not turned on, this is both due to extenuating circumstances such as a site wide power outage in early March and a dedicated two week noise hunting exercise in February. The physics data taking period ended at 3am on 19th March 2016 when a filtration pump broke causing an unrecoverable loss of purity as air was pumped into the detector. Following this studies to understand the electronics noise and to test the high voltage systems continued but it was deemed too costly to acquire any more physics data. During this time the electric field was raised to the nominal value of 500  V cm$^{-1}$, and some of the causes of the higher than expected noise levels were discerned. \\

%********************************** %First Section  **************************************
\section{Organisation of the data structure} \label{Organisation of the data structure} %Section - X.1
As previously noted the 35 ton consisted of three detector sub-systems: RCEs collecting TPC data, SSPs collecting photon detector data, and CRCs tagging cosmic rays. The DAQ combined these three data streams into synchronous events in time and saved them as LArSoft data objects. These data objects would later have to be converted to the offline data products which the reconstruction tools developed on simulation used, this is discussed in Section~\ref{Reformatting the data to the offline structure}. This section describes the structure of the data objects in the raw form.\\

During operations the DAQ was configured to maximise data throughput and physics potential. This meant recording different lengths of times for each of the three sub-systems as the data volumes and length of physics information were significantly different. For example due to the emission of prompt light the physics information from the SSPs is of a much shorter length of time than from the RCEs where data has to be recorded whilst the electrons drift through the LAr. During the running period the recorded data was triggered by through-going muons which produced coincidences on the CRCs on opposites side of the cryostat. A coincidence is defined as two CRC modules recording a hit within 30??? ns. The system used to collect the CRC data was also responsible for generating the triggers and so this meant that the trigger rate could be suppressed to approximately 1 Hz by only producing triggers every N times a coincidence occurred, where N was a tuneable variable. A trigger rate of 1 Hz was used as the maximum speed at which data could be written to disk was approximately 60 MB s$^{-1}$, which is roughly equal to the size of each triggered event when the entire detector is read-out in the configuration discussed below. The rate at which events were recorded could have been increased if zero-suppression of the TPC data had been used, however the noise level meant that this was not feasible. \\ 

With an electric field of 250 V cm$^{-1}$ and a drift of 2.25 m, the drift time for electrons at the long drift CPA was roughly 2.6 ms or 5200 ticks (where 1 tick is 500 ns). It was decided that in order for a track causing a counter coincidence to be separated from other tracks it was necessary to have roughly one drift window both before and after the drift window around the coincidence, meaning that data was recorded for 7.5 ms or 15,000 ticks around each coincidence. Only the prompt light from through-going particles was collected and so only 200 $\mu$s of SSP data was recorded for each event. The CRCs produced the least volume of data and so were able to be read out constantly. \\

As the run mode required accessing buffered data, it had to be discretised inside the components before being sent to the event builders in the DAQ. In the discussion of how this worked, focus will be given on the RCE data where some new terms need to be introduced. The smallest unit of data, called a nanoslice, is the data from one RCE for one tick, where each RCE controls 128 channels meaning that there were a total of 16 RCEs in the 35 ton. A microslice is then made by combining 1000$\times$N nanoslices such that it contains 0.5 ms (1,000 ticks) of data across all channels, where N is the number of RCEs that are recorded in the run. Microslices are then combined to make millislices the length of which was configurable. Once produced these millislices were sent by the DAQ to the event builders to be stored as time synchronous LArSoft data objects. \\

The time synchronous events produced by the DAQ did not, however, correspond to the physics events, this is because the DAQ was originally designed to produce a continuous data stream. This meant that the DAQ was configured to pad events with headers when a sub-system provided no physics information, such as nanoslices in the case of the RCEs. Removing these padded header objects was a remit of the online to offline converter discussed in Section~\ref{Reformatting the data to the offline structure}. As the length of the millislices was configurable it was chosen to be 10 ms (20,000 ticks) in order to best attempt to fully contain physics events and reduce the need for the online to offline converter to stitch DAQ events together. The padding of millislices with headers between physics events introduced some peculiarities in the data recorded such as millislices containing two parts of non-continuous data as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:DataStructure} where the second millislice has no information for the time between the end of physics event 2 and the start of physics event 3.\\

A group of 15 continuous red and green boxes are the recorded ``physics events''.Green boxes represent triggers which were used, with the black lines showing the time in the millislice at which the trigger occurred.

  \label{fig:DataStructure}
\end{figure}

During normal data taking the last N microslices are buffered in the RCEs so that if a trigger is issued the previous millislices can be accessed before they are deleted. As the data is buffered in the form of microslices, previous microslices may only be accessed in whole. This means that a whole number of microslices must be loaded before the trigger so, when a trigger is issued part way through a microslice, the previous X microslices are sent to the event builders. As a result during running there are always a minimum number of ticks both before (5,000 ticks) and after the trigger (9,000 ticks) but the exact numbers can change by up to 1,000 ticks for a given event depending on where in a microslice the trigger came. The result of this is that it is impossible to a priori know the number of ticks before/after a given counter coincidence. This is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:DataStructure} where the black lines representing triggers, are seen to occur at different points within the microslices. For example, physics event 1 will have more data after the trigger than physics event 2 as the trigger occurs earlier in the triggered microslice.

\section{Reformatting the data to the offline structure} \label{Reformatting the data to the offline structure} %Section - X.2
Conversion of the data objects stored in the raw data to the data objects used in simulation required a suite of unpacking services to be written, the specifics of which are not discussed here. These all required a common interface through which to access the data and check that the timing of each component was consistent, and then to produce a final LArSoft file for downstream use. This interface had the added role of producing complete physics events, meaning that it had to be able to combine multiple millislices and extract only the data containing the continuous physics events. \\

The format that the data reformatter followed was that upon unpacking each of the sub-systems, the TPC ticks would be looped through to see if a user defined set of conditions could be satisfied at that time. These conditions were usually whether an East-West or North-South counter coincidence occurred at that time, or if this millislice contained TPC data whilst the previous one did not. The latter was the default configuration as this gave the option of preserving all of the data gathered, for reasons discussed at the end of Section~\ref{Organisation of the data structure}. Other conditions were available, though rarely used, such as if the SSPs observed a large flash of flight, or if there was a large change in the average TPC ADC value. Once a set of conditions is satisfied a user defined number of pre-condition ticks are gathered. It is set to zero in the case of the previous millislice containing no TPC data as there is no previous data to load which would not have a gap in time, see Figure~\ref{fig:DataStructure}. In the case of using a counter coincidence to make an event, a value of 300 pre-condition ticks is normally used, with a maximum of 5000 ticks being able to reliably collected. Once the pre-conditions ticks are gathered a further N post-condition ticks are gathered, where N is defined by the user. Usually 15,000 ticks are gathered when the previous millislice is empty and 5,200 ticks are gathered when there is a coincidence, though a maximum of 9,000 ticks could be reliably gathered. Data from the other components is added to the event if its timestamp is within the timestamps of the first and last ticks in the event when no more TPC data is required or at the end of a millislice if stitching is required. All timestamps are corrected such that the event began at $t$=0 as the reconstruction assumes this and the timestamp of the start of the event is stored in the event record so that it can be accessed later if required. \\

At all points in this process it is important to integrate flexibility so that the user can choose the length of events, which sub-systems are in the events and what the conditions are for making events. It was also important for users to be able to run the service on already formatted events as the unpacking services were the major overhead in running the interface. It is also conceivable that users would want to reformat Monte Carlo events so as to centre them around their chosen conditions and so the use of the unpacking was determined by the interface depending on the format of the input file.

%********************************** % Third Section  *************************************
\section{Observations on data quality and noise mitigation} \label{sec:AllTheNoise} %Section - X.3
Reformatting the online data to the offline format was an important step in maintaining data quality as subsequently there was no access to the raw data due to the framework of the 35 ton software. Some of the important checks which were performed are outlined in Figure~\ref{fig:DataDrops}. If any of these issues were present in a given physics event then it is discarded as the integrity of the data cannot be guaranteed. It was decided that these events would be discarded as non-synchronous events would lead to hits in the detector being at incorrect times and padding empty events with pedestals could mean that tracks seem to disappear and later reappear as they travel through the detector. \\

Another example of inconsistent events is when the sub-systems are not synchronised with each other. This is normally caused by one of the sub-systems missing a clock increment from the master timing unit due to the data trigger being issued close to an increment from the master unit. This misalignment causes an incorrect time sample being read out and so the data from each sub-system within a millislice is not consistent meaning that it will fail the timestamp check and so won't be added to the event record. To avoid incomplete events these physics events are also discarded when observed. \\

One physics event straddling the millislice boundaries is shown and 4 RCEs representing each row are read out. The vertical blue lines delineate each microslice (0.5 ms, 1,000 ticks), with the thick blue line showing the millislice boundary. Solid red boxes represent micro slices with TPC data in them. It can be seen that RCEs 1 and 2 contain data for the same interval, whilst the data from RCE 3 in millislice 2 has been ``Dropped,'' and the data from RCE 4 is shifted by 1 microslice from RCEs 1 and 2 and is thus ``Inconsistent.'' As a result of these issues this physics event would be discarded as data integrity cannot be guaranteed.}
  \label{fig:DataDrops}
\end{figure}

The electronic noise in the 35 ton was higher than anticipated, with the RMS of the RCE ADC being approximately 30 counts compared to an expected thermal noise of around 2.5 ADC counts. Many sources contributed to this elevated noise, some of which are explained below. \\

Though not directly affecting the noise issues ``stuck ADC codes'' were a feature of the data which had to removed. ``Stuck ADC codes'' were caused by bit level corruption where lowest 6 bits in the ADC became frozen to either {\tt 0x0} or {\tt 0x3f}. This was observed during the first stages of commissioning and an algorithm to remove them was developed and tested on Monte Carlo~\citep{InslerStuckCode}. In simulations it was observed that the signal could be recovered with minimal losses, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:StuckCodes} where the blue lines (after removal) are seen to closely match the black lines (before adding stuck codes). \\

The black line shows the simulated signal on a wire, which is then modified by adding the effects of ``stuck ADC codes,'' shown by the red line. The ``stuck ADC codes'' are then removed, and the resulting signal is given by the blue line. It can be seen that the signal loss is minimal after the ``stuck ADC codes'' are removed. The figures were taken from~\citep{InslerStuckCode}.}
          \label{fig:StuckCodes}
\end{figure}

A significant portion of the noise was correlated between groups of 32 channels, where the ADCs would coherently oscillate. To remove these coherent shifts, ADC baselines were calculated for these groups of 32 channels at each tick and then subtracted from the measured ADC values. This was found to be an effective method of removing coherent noise in MicroBooNE \citep{uBooNENoise}. The effect of removing coherent noise is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:CoherentNoise}, where the signal peak becomes much easier to discern after noise removal and a coherent noise peak around tick 6030 is removed. An issue with removing coherent noise in this way is that events which are parallel to the APAs will produce signals at common times across adjacent wires and these signals may be removed along with the coherent noise causing a reduction in the hit reconstruction efficiency. The only way to prevent this is to ``protect'' potential signal regions from the coherent noise removal, as is done in MicroBooNE \citep{uBooNENoise}. \\

\end{figure}

When a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) \citep{CoTuFFT} is performed on the coherent noise subtracted waveforms, it can be seen that signals occur with specific frequencies. Some of these frequencies are caused by real energy depositions, whilst others are due to the electronics noise. It is possible to remove the noise frequencies by applying Wiener filters \citep{WienerFilter}. Frequency spectra are taken for each of the three planes and a clear signal is both preserved and suppressed. The raw signal spectra are then divided by the signal suppressed spectra to produce $signal/noise$ frequency spaces. The signal regions to be conserved, can then be found by fitting a combination of sigmoid functions to the frequency spaces around regions of high $signal/noise$. A demonstration of how this was applied, is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:FrequencyFilter}. It is also possible to remove specific frequencies which are not removed by the filters, this was necessary for a 54 KHz noise component introduced by the fluorescent lights in the detector hall. After the run ended it was found that some of the high frequency noise components were introduced by a short on a warm power cable, the techniques used to find this cable will be used when commissioning future detectors \citep{35tonNoiseMeeting}. \\

The plots show wire number, time in ticks and charge in ADC counts on the $x$, $y$ and $z$ axes respectively. The effect of the noise removal algorithms can clearly be seen, as large changes in charge due to the noise are no longer present after they have been applied. The application of the noise removal algorithms does however also remove real signals, as depositions across many channels at the same time which were present before their application can no longer be seen after they are applied.}
  \label{fig:NoiseRemoval}
\end{figure}

Transitions to a higher noise state associated with strong signals at high frequencies, between 400 and 650 KHz, were observed after cool down. The transitions would occur approximately every 2 hours and were occasionally observed to happen shortly after a saturation event across the whole detector \citep{35tonNoiseMeeting}. Once the state was induced the only way to stop it was to power cycle the low voltage supplies. It was found that power cycling APA3 could both stop and induce the higher noise state, importantly this was the only APA with electronics located at the base of the TPC. The data taken during the elevated noise state was unrecoverable as the electronics noise was too large, and so upon the observation of a transition the low voltage supplies were power cycled. It was observed that the transitions occurred much less frequently when APA3 was not powered and so it was not used for significant portions of the data taking period. Despite efforts to study the transitions during warm testing they were unable to be induced and have not been observed in other experiments such as MicroBooNE despite using the same low voltage supplies. It is thought that the cause of the transitions is a feedback loop in the low voltage cable which was much longer in the 35 ton than in MicroBooNE, this would explain why APA3 was more susceptible as the cable is routed past its electronics~\citep{35tonNoiseDoc}.

%********************************** % Fourth Section  *************************************
\section{Performance of reconstruction algorithms} \label{sec:DataAlgs}  %Section - X.4
Following the noise removal outlined above hit and track finding was still more difficult than in simulations due to the still elevated noise level. In order for a sensible number of hits to be reconstructed the hit finding threshold had to be substantially increased in data as compared to Monte Carlo, this meant that many of the low energy hits would not be reconstructed. \\

A potential solution to not reconstructing the low energy hits is to use the counter positions to select only hits which could have caused coincidences. When determining whether a reconstructed hit could have caused the counter coincidence a two-dimensional window around the counter edges in the $yz$ plane is constructed and timing information is used to extend this to three dimensions.  The $x$ position of the hit can be calculated using the hit time and electron drift velocity using Equation~\ref{eq:HitTime}. \\

Determining whether collection plane hits are within the counter window is trivial as they have a constant $z$ position and either cover the full detector height (tall APAs) or roughly half of the detector height (short APAs). The wrapping of the induction planes, however, means that each wire segment has to be considered individually and that multiple segments of a given wire could lie within the counter shadow. The 3-dimensional volume that is enclosed by connecting the edges of the counters which were hit to cause the counter coincidence, is called the ``counter shadow,'' and the wires which lie within the 2-dimensional projection of this volume onto the $yz$ plane are considered here. Choosing between these potential wire segments is done by iterating through the following steps. If at any point only one segment satisfies the condition then this segment is chosen:
\begin{itemize}
\item Does the wire segment intersect any collection plane wires which record hits?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item This is because when there is a signal on an induction plane there should also be signals on the collection wires.
  \end{itemize}
\item Are there adjacent wires which have hits at a similar time?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item This is because one would expect a track to deposit energy on multiple adjacent wire segments. 
  \end{itemize}
\item Which hit lies closest to the line defined by unique collection plane hits in the $xz$ plane?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item This is follows identical logic to the first criterion, but selects the hit which best matches the collection plane hits and attempts to remove the effect of noisy collection plane wires by only using wires which have one hit within the counter shadow. This would also hopefully improve the quality of the fit as there will not be numerous outlying hits.
  \item This can be changed to consider the line defined by previously selected hits in the given TPC and plane where the hit choices are.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
%DO I WANT SOME SORT OF FIGURE SHOWING THIS? LOTS OF HITS -> ONLY TRACK HITS? COL HITS USED IN ITEM 3, OVERLAYED WITH ALL INDUCTION PLANE HITS CONSIDERED, WITH THE ONES KEPT IN A DIFFERENT COLOUR? \\

Following a re-optimisation of the clustering algorithms it was observed that the standard reconstruction could achieve track reconstruction to a similar efficiency as the counter shadowing and so the standard reconstruction has been used in the discussions to follow \citep{TingjunClustering}. There has since been an effort to improve the counter shadowing hit disambiguation to remove the outlying collection plane hits using the MLESAC method \citep{MLESAC} whereby points which are far away from a best fit are ignored. These studies are still on-going~\citep{MattMLESAC}. \\

%****** Now to talk about the reconstruction efficiencies... ******%
A symptom of the elevated noise state is that signals are often dropped on one of the induction planes, this means that the tracking algorithms often have to combine clusters in only two of the three planes. Reconstruction using two planes was shown to be effective by the ArgoNeuT collaboration \citep{ArgoNeuT} so the loss of signal in one of the three planes is not prohibitive to track reconstruction. Another consequence of the elevated noise level is that even when the counters are used to seed hit finding, the hit finding threshold is too high to reconstruct the very lowest hits. This causes the plot of $dQ/dx$ for muons, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:TingjunLifetime}, to look flat due to a cutoff at 100 ADC cm$^{-1}$ below which no hits are found. The inability to reconstruct the lowest energy hits means that calorimetry is all but impossible on the 35 ton dataset even though the tracking algorithms perform relatively well. The inability to perform reliable calorimetry en masse means that the only particles which can be assuredly identified are the muons which triggered the counter coincidences, making the analysis proposed in Section~\ref{sec:PID} extremely difficult, if not impossible. \\

  \label{fig:TingjunLifetime}
\end{figure}  

The muons in the triggered sample will all traverse the detector but their orientations can be carefully selected by the user, for example one could easily select a sample of muons which cross the APAs at increasing angles, or are parallel to the wire planes at increasing drift distances by matching through-going muons with counter coincidences. The process by which this is done is identical for both North-South and East-West coincidences, though more focus will be given to the later and so it will be presented in that regard. The same matching technique would also have been applied to vertical muons had the telescope triggered been utilised. For a reference as to the location of the counter positions around the cryostat see Figure~\ref{fig:35tonCounterLoc}, and for a representation of only the East-West counters see Figure~\ref{fig:EWCounters}. \\

This is different to the LArSoft numbering scheme shown in Figure~\ref{fig:35tonCounterLoc} where they go from 6-15 and 28-37 for the East and West counters respectively. Three muons which would have caused coincidence triggers are shown as dashed lines, and the reconstructed tracks they produced are shown as solid lines. The red track would be an APA crossing event, and produced tracks in TPCs 1 and 6. The black muon was fully reconstructed as one continuous track, however the blue particle was not reconstructed in the middle TPCs and so was reconstructed as two separate tracks.}
  \label{fig:EWCounters}
\end{figure}

It is possible to construct a line in the $yz$ plane joining the centres of the two counters which were hit when a coincidence occurred, shown by the dashed line in Figure~\ref{fig:EWCounters}. This can then be compared with the trajectory of a track in the $yz$ plane and a dot product of the two vectors calculated. A reconstructed track is assigned to a given counter coincidence if the dot product of the track and the coincidence is more than 0.98 and the hit times are consistent with the $x$ positions of the counters. The results of the dot product calculation are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:CounterCoincidence}. Matching only tracks which are well aligned with a counter coincidence should produce a pure sample of tracks, as parallel muons are unlikely to be highly correlated in time and any tracks reconstructed from the noise will have random directions. This is shown in data where if multiple tracks pass the dot product cut they are co-linear and are not randomly orientated, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:CounterTrackAngle}. \\

          \label{fig:CounterTrackAngle}
\end{figure}

By matching tracks in this way it is possible to evaluate the reconstruction efficiencies for these muons at increasing drift distances and track angles. If multiple tracks are aligned with the coincidence and are within the expected time region then their track lengths are summed when calculating reconstruction efficiencies as it is expected that the track was split by a region of the detector either being turned off or too noisy to reliably reconstruct a track. If these tracks have a combined track length of more than 50 cm then the coincidence is identified as having been successfully reconstructed. This threshold is much lower than the true track length which should be reconstructed, >150 cm, but few particles are fully reconstructed in the data and so a compromise is made to achieve a large enough sample of tracks upon which analyses can be performed. A reconstructed track that is 50 cm long is likely to have a large number of hits on collection plane wires that are not noisy, and it is these hits which are required when calculating purity or measuring the effect of diffusion as discussed in Section~\ref{DiffusionAnalysis}. A track with length more than 50 cm is also likely to have been stitched between TPCs due to the geometry of the 35 ton and track trajectories. The demonstration of stitching tracks between TPCs was a design goal of the 35 ton, and so identifying tracks where this was achieved satisfies that goal. \\

An important concept that must be introduced before these reconstruction efficiencies can be described is that of a ``counter difference.'' The ``counter difference'' of a coincidence and it's associated tracks is defined as the absolute difference between the counter numbers of the East and West counters that were hit, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:CounterCoincidence}. As such, the ``counter differences'' of the coincidences shown in Figure~\ref{fig:CounterCoincidence} are 2, 3 and 6 for the black, red and blue coincidences respectively. Given the orientation of the counters, the rarest counter difference will be 9, as only particles which hit counters ($E_0$ and $W_9$) and ($E_9$ and $W_0$) will have a counter difference of 9. In contrast to this, the most common value for the counter difference is 1, as there are many possible combinations of East and West counters being hit to give this counter difference. In the discussions below ``counter difference'' is occasionally referred to as ``delta counter'' or ``$\Delta$ counter.'' The approximate angles which tracks with given counter differences have relative to the APA frames is shown in Table~\ref{tab:CDiffAng}. \\

Figure~\ref{fig:DataRecoEffics} shows a range of reconstruction efficiency plots for combinations of different counter differences and different drift distances. As the counter coincidences with large counter differences will have large variations in drift positions, the drift distance plotted here is the average $x$ position of the counter centres that were hit. For example, if the two counters that produced the coincidence are at 10 cm and 230 cm respectively, then the drift distance plotted would be 120 cm. This distance is called the ``coincidence centre'' in the following discussion. It should be noted that only coincidences which would produce tracks that are contained within the long drift volume are considered here, hence there being no negative $x$ positions. \\

Though the East and West counters have a width in the $y$ (vertical) direction, this is much less than their extent in the $z$ direction. The depth of the counters, their extent in $x$ is negligible compared to the separation of the East-West counters. The counters have identical widths in both the $y$ and $z$ directions. The angles are calculated using the difference in the centres of the counters in the $z$ direction divided by the separation of the East and West counters in $z$.}

From Figure~\ref{fig:AngleCanvas} it is evident that the reconstruction efficiency for tracks with shallow angles relative to the APAs is extremely poor, with the efficiency for tracks aligned with counter differences of 0 or 1 never rising above 10\%. This is due to the coherent noise removal where hits which are correlated in time will be removed as they will be perceived as being noise as opposed to real signals. As the difference in counter number increases the efficiency is seen to increase, though the rate of this increase is seen to depend on the ``coincidence centre''. The effect of increasing ``coincidence centre'' can be seen more clearly in Figure~\ref{fig:DistanceCanvas} where the efficiency for each counter difference as a function of ``coincidence centre'' is plotted. Here it can be seen that the reconstruction efficiency decreases for coincidences that are centred further away from the APAs. This is due to the fact that when an energy deposition has further to drift, it will induce a smaller pulse on the wires meaning that it is more likely to be below the hit threshold. Figure~\ref{fig:TwoDimCanvas} combines Figures~\ref{fig:AngleCanvas} and~\ref{fig:DistanceCanvas} to show how the reconstruction efficiency for increasing ``coincidence centre'' changes with increasing counter difference. It can be seen that tracks with counter differences of between 3 and 5 where the ``coincidence centre'' is between 60 cm and 140 cm away from the APAs are the best reconstructed coincidences. Finally, Figure~\ref{fig:CounterDiffFreq} shows how the frequency of coincidences of a given counter difference occurs compared to how many events contain reconstructed tracks which are aligned with the coincidence. It can be seen that as stated earlier, the most common counter difference is 1, with the least common being a counter difference of 9. However, given the low reconstruction efficiency seen for the lowest counter differences few tracks are reconstructed. This means that when considering the reconstructed tracks, most are due to coincidences with counter differences of either 3, 4 or 5.

\section{Measuring interaction times using electron diffusion}  \label{DiffusionAnalysis}%Section - X.5
As electrons drift from the interaction point to the wire planes they become spread out in both time and space, this effect is known as diffusion and is an important property of electron transport in LAr which must be well understood. The mechanism by which diffusion occurs in LAr was first discussed by Atrazhev-Timoshkin~\citep{Atrazhev-Timoshkin}, and has since been developed to consist of a complete set of measurements for electric fields between 100 and 2000 V cm$^{-1}$~\citep{Li:2015rqa}. The diffusion of electrons is rarely isotropic and so the component that is transverse to the drift field and the component that is parallel to the drift field are normally measured separately. Diffusion parallel to the drift field is called longitudinal diffusion and is generally smaller than the component of diffusion that is transverse to the drift field. Figure~\ref{fig:DomDiffSchem} shows how diffusion can smear the electrons collected on a set of wires when the electrons are initially highly correlated in time and space. \\

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{DiffusionSchematic}
  \caption[Schematic showing the process of diffusion]
          {A schematic showing the longitudinal diffusion (left) and transverse diffusion (right) of electrons. In both cases four electrons are initially shown below four wires, and are allowed to diffuse in either the drift direction or perpendicular to the drift direction in the longitudinal and transverse cases respectively. It can be seen that the effect of the diffusion is to make the electrons spread out in time in the case of longitudinal diffusion and to spread out in space in the case of transverse diffusion. Figure taken from~\citep{DomSeptMeeting}.}
  \label{fig:DomDiffSchem}
\end{figure}

Longitudinal diffusion has the effect of spreading the drifting electrons out in time causing signals to become wider in time and smaller in height as the total charge is conserved. The increasing hit width can be measured for increasing drift times (distances) provided the hits do not fall below a hit finding threshold. Transverse diffusion causes drifting electrons to spread out in space, changing the amount of charge deposited on a wire and reducing the charge resolution of the detector. Transverse diffusion is measured by discerning how the width of the hit charge distribution changes for increasing drift distances~\citep{Li:2015rqa}. \\

Through-going particles make ideal tracks to study diffusion as they are minimally ionising and so have roughly constant energy depositions along their tracks. The tracks they produce can also cover a wide range of drift distances if they are not parallel to the APAs. The drift distances of hits within a track can be determined by matching the track with a counter coincidence as discussed at the end of Section~\ref{sec:DataAlgs} and then correcting the $x$ co-ordinates of the hits using the result of Equation~\ref{eq:HitTime_Int} in Equation~\ref{eq:HitTime}. \\

Traditionally the only way to determine an interaction time for a track is to match it to either an external calibration source such as whether it aligns with an external counter coincidence, or to match it to a flash of scintillation light as in Section~\ref{sec:SimInteractionTimes}. These techniques are particularly crucial for neutrino detectors on the Earths surface such as MicroBooNE where each neutrino interaction usually has a background of at least one cosmic muon. The reconstructed tracks from this muon background has to be distinguished from those due to the neutrino interaction in order correctly assign a scintillation flash to the reconstructed tracks. An example of an event that has many scintillation flashes and cosmic muons which need to be correctly associated, is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:DiffLotsOfFlashes}. However, it may be possible that the change in hit width due to diffusion as a particle travels through the detector, could be used to determine the interaction time; though this has not been attempted before. To study whether this is possible, the effects of diffusion would have to be measured for a sample of tracks with known interaction times and orientations. \\

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{LotsOfTrackFlash}
  \caption[A simulated event display showing multiple tracks and flashes in the 35 ton]
          {A simulated event display showing multiple tracks and flashes to be assigned to each other in the 35 ton. The coloured lines represent reconstructed tracks, whilst the coloured dashed boxes represent flashes.}
          \label{fig:DiffLotsOfFlashes}
\end{figure}

The 35 ton dataset is ideal for testing this hypothesis as the counters are able to provide a sample of tracks with known angles and interaction times which can be used to tune interaction time determination metrics. These metrics can then be applied to another sample of tracks where the interaction time is known but not used so that the accuracy of the calculated interaction times can be found. As longitudinal diffusion is the dominant effect that increases the hit width, transverse diffusion will not be directly considered further. However, as noted in Section~\ref{sec:DataAlgs}, the noise level in the 35 ton data causes reconstruction issues and so it is also useful to compare the method against a low noise detector. Monte Carlo can provide this sample, and this comparison is shown in Section~\ref{sec:MCDataComp}. It is also useful to observe the effects that different detector conditions such as, the electric field, the electron lifetime, noise level and rate of diffusion have on the method. This is shown in Section~\ref{sec:DiffMCStudies}. First though, the method is performed on the 35 ton dataset.

%********************************** % Fifth.First Section  *************************************
\subsection{Determining interaction times in 35 ton data}
When calculating the determination metrics, only hits on wires which are not noisy want to be considered. This is because wires with a high level of correlated noise observe hits with a wider RMS. This is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:DomsHitModel}, where, when a baseline noise of 10 ADC counts is added to a simulated hit with a peak value of 50 ADC counts and an RMS of 10 ticks, the width increases by over 10\%. Hits with delta rays also need to be removed as the deposited energy will be larger and over a longer period of time than hits from the main track, this will make the RMS of the individual hit wider and also increase the width of the charge distribution for the track. To remove these hits only hits which satisfy the following cuts are used:
\begin{itemize}
\item No hit on the same wire within 50 ticks of the hit in question - removes delta rays.
\item No more than 10 hits on the same wire in the whole 15,000 tick data sample - removes clearly noisy wires.
\end{itemize}
These cuts will clearly become much more restrictive as the noise level in the detector increases, but they are essential in order to collect a dataset which is not overpowered by noise. Only collection plane hits are used, as the charge resolution is better and the signals are unipolar as opposed to bipolar meaning that a Gaussian function can be easily fitted to the signals. Additionally the $signal/noise$ ratio on the collection planes was much higher than on the induction planes for the 35 ton dataset and so the hits could be much more reliably reconstructed. \\

In reality the noise would fluctuate with time. When a Gaussian function is fitted to each signal, it is seen to be more than 10\% larger for the signal where the noise baseline is added. This shows that noise can cause the measured width of a hit to increase. Figure taken from~\citep{DomSeptMeeting}.}
          \label{fig:DomsHitModel}
\end{figure}  

Diffusion is a track angle dependent property and so track angle ranges have to be considered independently. To minimise the number of figures presented, only graphs made for tracks which have a counter difference of 4 are shown, though the procedure is identical for tracks of all counter differences. Tracks with a counter difference of 4 were chosen as they were one of the angles for which tracks were well recosntructed in the data, see Figure~\ref{fig:DataRecoEffics}. The tracks are considered en masse, and so the hits for every track are separated into 10 cm regions of increasing drift distance from the APAs. The following quantities are calculated for each 10 cm drift region:
\begin{itemize}
\item The hit $RMS$ - the most direct way to measure transverse diffusion.
\item The hit $RMS/Charge$ - an attempt to incorporate the effect of impurities in the LAr for relatively low purity data which will have a drift distance dependence.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The charge of a hit is calculated by integrating the ADCs of the reconstructed hit over time. 
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Fitting Gaussian functions around the peaks of the distributions will yield the most probable values for the drift regions, as is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:DiffDataHitFit}. \\

          \label{fig:DiffDataHitFit}
\end{figure}

The drift distance effect of diffusion can then be observed by fitting these most probable values as drift distance increases. This drift distance dependence is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:CDiff4DataFit} for tracks that are associated with a coincidence which had a counter difference of 4. The angular dependence can then be shown by observing how the most probable fit value at a drift distance of 0 cm changes for increasing angles, this is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:DiffData_AngFit}. A drift distance dependence can clearly be seen in the data as the most probable hit $RMS$ is seen to increase for hits which originate further from the APAs. It also clear that there is an angular dependence on the hit width as the most probable hit widths next to the APAs is seen to rise for tracks associated with coincidences with large counter differences. These dependencies show that, when considering a large sample, diffusion can be separated into distance and angular dependant dependencies, however whether this can be observed for individual tracks has not yet been considered. \\

  \label{fig:DiffData_AngFit}
\end{figure}

To consider single tracks, the best line fits for the counter differences for a large sample of tracks, such as in Figure~\ref{fig:CDiff4DataFit}, need to be used to predict the position you would expect a hit to originate from given a value for its hit $RMS$ and the angle of the track to which it belongs. The predicted positions can then be compared to the known position from the counter coincidence to determine the accuracy of the prediction. As the distributions shown in Figure~\ref{fig:DiffDataHitFit} are roughly symmetric around the most probable value one would naively expect that if a track has a sufficient number of hits then the distribution of RMS values for those hits would match that found over a large sample. If this were to be the case then the difference in reconstructed and predicted hit times should be peaked around the track interaction time. \\

An intrinsic assumption in this method is that the track has a large number of collection plane hits that do not contain delta rays and are on wires which would not be identified as noisy. The tracks being considered will have crossed all $z$ values in the detector meaning that a total of 336 collection hits could potentially be reconstructed. Given the reconstruction problems in the 35 ton detector, very few tracks will have hits on all of these collection wires. However, requiring at least 100 collection plane hits is not unreasonable and would correspond to a reconstructed track length of at least 50 cm. The difference between the predicted and reconstructed hit time for each hit is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:DiffDataPredHit} for both the hit $RMS$ and hit $RMS/Charge$ metrics. \\

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{DifferenceInteractionTime_Data}

          {The difference between the predicted and reconstructed hit times in the 35 ton dataset. The differences in time when the hit $RMS$ metric is used are shown in black, whilst the differences in time when the hit $RMS/Charge$ metric is used are shown in blue.}
  \label{fig:DiffDataPredHit}
\end{figure}

It can be seen from Figure~\ref{fig:DiffDataPredHit}, that in the 35 ton dataset both distributions are centred around a time difference of 0 $\mu$s which is encouraging as it shows that the method has potential. The width of the distribution for the $RMS/Charge$ metric is smaller, and the peak larger, so it is expected that this will provide the more robust metric. This is because these features show that the hit times which are predicted, are more likely to be close to the reconstructed hit times. The peaks are centred around a time difference of 0 as the hit times had previously had the measured interaction time, from the counter coincidence, subtracted from them. This was done so as to avoid the uncertainty which would arise from allowing the coincidences to remain at random times between ticks 5000 and 6000, see the discussion concerning Figure~\ref{fig:DataStructure} for an explanation as to why this occurs. \\

When evaluating interaction times the average difference in reconstructed and predicted hit times across every hit on the track must be considered. This is shown in Figures~\ref{fig:DiffDataAvDiff_RMS} and~\ref{fig:DiffDataAvDiff_RMS_Int}, where, as expected from Figure~\ref{fig:DiffDataPredHit}, the $RMS/Charge$ metric provides a better estimation of the interaction time. The reason for this is that by utilising the charge information due to losses from impurities this metric gains an extra handle on the drift distance and hence the reconstructed time of the hits. The losses due to impurities are difficult to measure in high-purity LAr environments as the decrease in collected charge with increasing drift distances is small~\citep{LongBo}. The effect of increasing LAr purity is shown in Section~\ref{sec:DiffMCStudies}. Using the change in hit charge in the 35 ton may have a drawback though, because, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:TingjunLifetime}, there is a threshold effect for hits with large drift times. However, as the same threshold effect is present in all 35 ton data samples the limitation it introduces is mainly in the efficiency with which 'good' collection plane hits will be reconstructed and so this information can be confidently used. \\

Figure~\ref{fig:DiffDataAvDiff_RMS} shows that using the effects of diffusion, and the hit $RMS$, the interaction time and central $x$ position of a track can be reliably predicted in the 35 ton dataset. The accuracy in determing the interaction time is found to be 298 $\mu$s, where the distrbitution has a FWHM of 267 $\mu$s. When this is converted into the difference in central $x$ position of the track the accuracy is found to be 32.2 cm with a FWHM of 28.8 cm. \\

Figure~\ref{fig:DiffDataAvDiff_RMS_Int} shows that using the effects of diffusion, and the hit $RMS/Charge$, the interaction time and central $x$ position of a track can be reliably predicted in the 35 ton dataset. The accuracy in determing the interaction time is found to be 55.3 $\mu$s, where the distrbitution has a FWHM of 212 $\mu$s. When this is converted into the difference in central $x$ position of the track the accuracy is found to be 6.88 cm with a FWHM of 23.1 cm. \\

The resolutions found are quite impressive as given that the total drift time for electrons through the whole 35 ton detector volume of 250 cm is roughly 5200 ticks, it means that tracks can be distinguished throughout the detector volume. As discussed earlier, the issues with noise in the 35 ton dataset affect the accuracy with which tracking and calorimetry can be performed, and so it is reasonable to expect that the effectiveness of the interaction time determination was also affected. Therefore, it is purdent to repeat the study on a Monte Carlo dataset where the detector noise is much lower. This is presented in Section~\ref{sec:MCDataComp}.

%********************************** % Fifth.Second Section  *************************************
\subsection{Determining interaction times in a low-noise detector using Monte Carlo, and differences with data} \label{sec:MCDataComp}
When determining interaction times in Monte Carlo simulations, exactly the same criteria are applied to the hits, as $\delta$-rays would still change the measured hit width and will be present in any sample. In a low noise detector it is expected that few wires would be removed due to being noisy but for consistency there is no danger in applying this cut. Imposing a minimum number of collection plane hits is again important to ensure that the distribution of predicted hit times is centred on the interaction time. In addition to the same criteria being imposed on which wires are used, the same metrics are calculated. In all plots shown below the Monte Carlo dataset has been normalised to the size of the 35 ton dataset. \\

Figure~\ref{fig:DiffMCHitFit} shows both the hit $RMS$ and hit $RMS/Charge$ distributions for hits that are 100 cm away from the APAs and are from tracks assoicated with a coincidence that has a counter difference of 4. It can be seen that the distributions from the Monte Carlo simulation are tighter than those from the 35 ton data and are also peaked at a lower values of hit $RMS$. This is likely due to the fact that the coherent noise baseline seen in data can increase the width of hits as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:DomsHitModel} and a higher noise state will affect how well individual hits can be reconstructed. In addition, the most probable values of hit $RMS$ at increasing drift distance are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:DiffMCDataCompFit} where the Monte Carlo simulation is again shown with the values from the data. The most probable value of hit $RMS$ at a drift distance of 0 cm for a range of counter differences is also shown in Figure~\ref{fig:DiffMCDataCompInt}. As was seen when considering the distributions at specific distances and counter differences, the most probable values of hit $RMS$ in the Monte Carlo simulation is systematically lower than in the data due to the elevated noise level seen in the data. Another difference between the Monte Carlo and the data is that the gradient of the most probable values of hit $RMS$ in data is roughly half of that in the Monte Carlo, this could be due to an overestimation of longitudinal diffusion in the Monte Carlo. \\

Upon calculating the fit metrics in the low-noise Monte Carlo dataset it is then possible to use these to predict track interaction times, this is shown in Figures~\ref{fig:DiffOverlayAvDiff_RMS} and~\ref{fig:DiffOverlayAvDiff_RMS}. Figure~\ref{fig:DiffOverlayAvDiff_RMS} compares how reliably the interaction time and central $x$ position of a track can be predicted, using the effect that diffusion has on the hit $RMS$, in the 35 ton dataset and a low-noise Monte Carlo sample. The accuracy in determing the interaction time in Monte Carlo (data) is found to be 168 (298) $\mu$s, where the distrbitution has a FWHM of 127 (267) $\mu$s. When this is converted into the difference in central $x$ position of the track the accuracy is found to be 19.4 (32.2) cm with a FWHM of 14.0 (28.8) cm. Figure~\ref{fig:DiffOverlayAvDiff_RMS} compares how reliably the interaction time and central $x$ position of a track can be predicted, using the effect that diffusion has on the hit $RMS/Charge$, in the 35 ton dataset and a low-noise Monte Carlo sample.

When this is converted into the difference in central $x$ position of the track the accuracy is found to be -3.5 (6.88) cm with a FWHM of 12.1 (23.1) cm. \\

The hit $RMS/Charge$ metric appears to be able to more accurately predict interaction times, as was seen in when considering the 35 ton dataset. This is again due to the ability to incorporate information about loses due to impurities which increase with drift distance. Also, as expected from the previous figures and the lower noise state in the Monte Carlo it is seen that the interaction times predicted in the Monte Carlo more closely match the true interaction times than in the data. An important feature to observe is that, as well as more accurately predicting the interaction times, the widths of the distributions in Monte Carlo are less than half of that in the data. This means that the resolution with which tracks can be distinguished in the Monte Carlo sample is much better than in the 35 ton dataset, again this is attributed to the lower noise level in the Monte Carlo. \\

The calculation of interaction times is clearly much better in the low-noise Monte Carlo than in the 35 ton dataset, however, the distributions are still not centred around 0 implying that there is a systematic error in the method which has not been removed when considering a low-noise environment. Looking at Figure~\ref{fig:DiffMCHitFit} the impact of $\delta$-rays can still be seen where the hit $RMS$ plot still has quite a significant tail above the most probable value. This will cause the predicted interaction times to be skewed towards larger times as the hits containing $\delta$-rays will be wider and so appear to come at later times than they actually do. Hits containing undistinguishable $\delta$-rays are difficult to remove without looking for slight dips in the raw signals caused by the $\delta$-ray beginning to separate from the main track. This would be almost impossible in the 35 ton dataset given the oscillatory nature of the noise. $\Delta$-rays can also offer an explanation for the $RMS/Charge$ plot underestimating interaction time as hits containing $\delta$-rays would deposit more charge and this increased charge would likely be larger than the increased width, causing the $RMS/Charge$ to decrease. This is seen in Figure~\ref{fig:DiffMCHitFit} where both the data and Monte Carlo samples have tails at small values of hit $RMS/Charge$, this decrease in hit $RMS/Charge$ would lead to an underestimation of the interaction time. The 35 ton dataset as a whole overestimates the interaction time though, and this is due to the tail at large values of hit $RMS/Charge$ seen in the 35 ton dataset. It is thought that the collection of hits with large values of hit $RMS/Charge$ is correlated with the noise level in the detector, as it is not seen in the lower noise Monte Carlo sample. \\

%********************************** % Fifth.Third Section  *************************************
\subsection{Discerning the impact of changing detector properties using Monte Carlo samples} \label{sec:DiffMCStudies}
The difficulty of the reconstruction and analysis of the 35 ton data is due to the elevated noise level. We are now going to verify this statement with a study whereby the noise level in a Monte Carlo sample is changed from the low-noise state used in the previous section, to a level more similar to that which is seen in the 35 ton dataset. If the claim that the noise level made reconstruction difficult is correct, then the the accuracy with which the interaction time can be determined, should be seen to anti-correlate with the noise level of the simualted detector. This study and the ones which follow have all been performed using the same muons, so as to ensure that the only difference between the different samples are the detector conditions, and only one detector condition is varied at a time. As such, there is one sample that is consistent to all samples, which is where the RMS of the noise is 2.5 ADCs, the electron lifetime is 3 ms, the electric field is 500 V cm$^{-1}$ and the coefficient of longitudinal diffusion is 6.2$\times$10$^9$. When presenting the studies with changing detector conditions, the analagous figures presented in the previous section are repeated so as to show how the critical aspects of the methodology are affected. \\

%%%%%%%% The noise simulation....
Figures~\ref{fig:DiffLifeStudy_AvDiff_RMS} and~\ref{fig:DiffLifeStudy_AvDiff_RMS_Int} show the accuracy to which the interaction time and central $x$ position of a track can be determined using the effect that diffusion has on the hit $RMS$ and hit $RMS/Charge$ as the changing electronics noise level respectively. Figures~\ref{fig:DiffLifeStudy_AvDiff_RMS} and~\ref{fig:DiffLifeStudy_AvDiff_RMS_Int} both show that the integrity of the fits decrease with increasing noise levels, but they show this in very different ways which is very interesting. As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:AllTheNoise}, the 35 ton data had significant amounts of coherent noise which was not expected and so had been previously simulated. As this level of coherent noise is not expected in future detectors, coherent noise has not been simulated in these increased noise level samples. Instead, the electronics noise, or 'thermal noise,' has been varied. The lowest noise level was the design noise level for the 35 ton and is what is used in the 'baseline' sample in the plots to follow. This level of thermal noise is very minimal, and so only noise levels which are more than this have been simualted as the $signal/noise$ ratio which one gets with such a low ADC RMS is large, and so a decrease in this noise level is unlikely to make a significant difference in the accuracy of the method. However, as can be seen in the 35 ton data and the following plots, increasing the noise level has serious consequences. \\

\end{figure}

A key factor that has to be considered here when comparing the following plots to those that are from data, is that, no noise mitigation algorithms have been applied to the increased noise samples. Instead, the threshold that the hit finder uses has been increased to the level that was neccessary for a reasonable number of hits to be reconstructed. Here, a reasonable number of hits simply means, not reconstructing such a large number of noise pulses that they outwiegh the number of true signals from tracks. The hit threshold which was required was determined by looking at the deconvoluted signal and choosing a threshold which was above the majority of the noise signals. The hit threshold used for each level are summarised below:
\begin{itemize}
\item Noise level of 2.5 ADC RMS - hit threshold of 6 ADC
\item Noise level of 5 ADC RMS - hit threshold of 10 ADC
\item Noise level of 7.5 ADC RMS - hit threshold of 15 ADC
\item Noise level of 10 ADC RMS - hit threshold of 20 ADC
\end{itemize}
This means that the main effect of increasing the noise level is to remove the low charge hits, as the will fall below threshold as it increases due to the noise level. \\

Firstly, considering Figure~\ref{fig:DiffLifeStudy_AvDiff_RMS}, it can be seen that the accuracy to which interaction times can be determined rapidly decreases as the noise level increases. In the case of the highest noise level considered here, the fits used to make the prediction metrics do not converge for counter differences of 1, 2, 3 and 4 as the MPV of hit $RMS$ is not seen to increase for increasing drift distances. For evidence of this, see the Figures in Appendix~\ref{sec:DiffMCPlots}. Though this is the extreme case, it can be seen that the validity of the hit $RMS$ for increasing drift distances becomes less predictable as the noise is increased. The result of this is a less accurate prediction metric, which leads to the large offsets and widths of the distributions that are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:DiffLifeStudy_AvDiff_RMS}.\\

The most striking feature of Figure~\ref{fig:DiffLifeStudy_AvDiff_RMS_Int} is the decrease in statistics seen for the increasing noise levels. This shows the effect that increasing the noise level and hence hit threshold has as fewer tracks in total are reconstructed, and those that do are less likely to meet the criteria about the number of collection hits required to make predictions. It is however interesting to note that the centre of the distributions moves closer to the true interaction time as the noise increases. Supposing that two groups of hits from the same point have the same hit $RMS$, but one group deposits significantly more charge than the other, then removing the hits with the lower charge will cause the number of hits in the hit $RMS$ plot to decrease, but the shape of the distribution will be unchaged. However, removing the hits with lower charge will siginificantly change the $RMS/Charge$ distribution, as the tail which they cause will no longer be there. The result of this is that more of the hits used to make predictions are within the peak of the distribution, and so the prediction should become more accurate. The reduction in hit and track reconstruction which this entails is not justified when performing whole-scale reconstruction, however, only using hits with a minimum charge could prove beneficial when making predictions. \\

%%%%%%%% The Electron lifetime study

Figures~\ref{fig:DiffLifeStudy_AvDiff_RMS} and~\ref{fig:DiffLifeStudy_AvDiff_RMS_Int} show the accuracy to which the interaction time and central $x$ position of a track can be determined using the effect that diffusion has on the hit $RMS$ and hit $RMS/Charge$ for changing electron lifetimes respectively. Figure~\ref{fig:DiffLifeStudy_AvDiff_RMS} shows that with an electron lifetime of 1 ms, the hit $RMS$ metric is very inaccurate, this is likely due to hits which are a large distance away from the APAs being very difficult to reconstruct due to the extremely poor lifetime. For this reason, the accuracy to which the hit $RMS$ metric predicts the interaction time improves as the electron lifetime increases, though this increase in small between the 3 ms, 5 ms and 8 ms samples. Figure~\ref{fig:DiffLifeStudy_AvDiff_RMS_Int} shows the opposite effect, the accuracy to which the interaction time can be determined decreases with increasing electron lifetime for the hit $RMS/Charge$ metric. This is because the decrease in hit charge is much greater when the electron lifetime is lower. This dependence is the corner stone of this metric, which is why it performs so well for low electron lifetimes, and so the decrease in its accuracy is an unavoidable consequence of increasing electron lifetime. \\

%%%%%%%% The Electric field study

Figures~\ref{fig:DiffElecStudy_AvDiff_RMS} and~\ref{fig:DiffElecStudy_AvDiff_RMS_Int} show the accuracy to which the interaction time and central $x$ position of a track can be determined using the effect that diffusion has on the hit $RMS$ and hit $RMS/Charge$ for changing electric field values respectively. Figures~\ref{fig:DiffElecStudy_AvDiffRMS_T} and~\ref{fig:DiffElecStudy_AvDiffRMS_Int_T} show that the accuracy to which the interaction time can be determined is relatively unaffected by the electric field for both the hit $RMS$ and hit $RMS/Charge$ methods. However, when these interaction times are used to predict the central $x$ position the larger drift velocity in the higher electric field samples causes the accuracy to decrease. This decrease in accuracy is because within the same time period electrons will have drifted further in a higher drift field, meaning that the same error in time will produce a larger $x$ offset when compared a lower electric field. The increased field also causes the distributions of the difference in predicted and reconstructed central $x$ position to become wider, particularly in Figure~\ref{fig:DiffElecStudy_AvDiff_RMS_Int_X}, again this is due to the increase drift velocity as the widths of Figure~\ref{fig:DiffElecStudy_AvDiff_RMS_Int_T} are consistent. \\

Figures~\ref{fig:DiffLDiff_AvDiff_RMS} and~\ref{fig:DiffLDiff_AvDiff_RMS_Int} show the accuracy to which the interaction time and central $x$ position of a track can be determined using the effect that diffusion has on the hit $RMS$ and hit $RMS/Charge$ for changing values of the longitudinal diffusion constant respectively. As would be expected, both figures show that the accuracy to which the interaction time and central $x$ position can be predicted are highly dependant on the longitudinal diffusion constant. It is interesting to note that the extremely poor resolution when there is no longitudinal seen in Figure~\ref{fig:DiffLDiff_AvDiff_RMS} is not present in Figure~\ref{fig:DiffLDiff_AvDiff_RMS_Int}. It is thought that this is due to charge attentuation which will still occur due to the finite electron lifetime.

\subsection{The limitations of and future improvements to the method of interaction time determination using diffusion} \label{sec:DiffLimitations}
The comparison of the 35 ton data and Monte Carlo samples, as well as the Monte Carlo samples with differeing detector conditions, show that there is potential in the ability to determine interaction times using the effects of diffusion. However, there are still some issues which need to be overcome. These will be discussed briefly below. \\

All of the figures shown that had the difference in predicted and reconstructed interaction times were not centered around 0 $\mu$s and also had large FWHMs. It is thought that this is due to interpreting distributions which are not Gaussian as Gaussian functions, such as Figure~\ref{fig:DiffMCHitFit}. This means that when the MPVs are calculated using only the values around the peaks, there are large tails at both high and low values which are not counted. As the hits which make up these tails are still used to predict the interaction times they will introduce the observed offsets as the times which they would predict will be far from that which the MPV would predict. The result of this is that the assumption made earlier, that over a large number of hits the average predicted interaction time will be correct, could no longer hold. A potential solution to remedy this, is to refine the selection of hits that are used to predict the interaction time to exclude the extreme values of these tails. However, to do this accurately would require some knowledge of the hit location, as the MPV of hit $RMS$ can change significantly over the drift length of the detector. This is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:DiffMCDataCompFit}, where the MPV of hit $RMS$ in Monte Carlo changes from roughly 1.9 ticks near the APAs to roughly 2.8 ticks 200 cm away from the APAs. Looking at Figure~\ref{fig:DiffMCHitFit_RMS}, this range encompasses the entire distrbibution of Monte Carlo hit $RMS$ values, including the tail of hit $RMS$ above 2.3 ticks which we would like to remove. Another solution to improving the accuracy of the predicted interaction time could be to weight the predicted interaction times from each hit in some way which better represents the distribution of hit $RMS$ and hit $RMS/Charge$ seen in Figure~\ref{fig:DiffMCHitFit}. \\

An important improvement to the method would be to expand it to include the induction plane wires, as this will greatly increase both the number of wires which can be used, and the range of track angles whose interaction times can be predicted. The angular range of the method would increase as, when using only collection plane wires it is impossible to reconstruct enough hits for nearly vertical muons as very few wires would be hit, this was discussed in Section~\ref{sec:SimRecoEffic}. This was not attempted here as the electronics noise in the 35 ton data was too large to able to reliably reconstruct all hits on the induction planes without reconstructing many noise hits, and so the hit threshold was very high. \\
