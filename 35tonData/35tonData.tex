The data taking period for the 35 ton prototype was from November 2015 until March 2016. This included an extensive commissioning period before the detector was filled with LAr and the electric field was turned on. During this time many of the features of the data discussed below were first noticed and attempts to rectify these were pursued. A long commissioning period was also required because many of the DAQ sub-systems were still under active development in November.\\

A total of 22 days worth of data was collected with the electric field set at 250 V cm$^{-1}$, the breakdown of when these periods occurred is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:DataCollected}. It is clear that the analysable data is interspersed with data where the electric field was not turned on, this is both due to extenuating circumstances such as a site wide power outage in early March and a dedicated two week noise hunting exercise in February. The physics data taking period ended at 3am on 19th March 2016 when a filtration pump broke causing an unrecoverable loss of purity as air was pumped into the detector. Following this studies to understand the electronics noise and to test the high voltage systems continued but it was deemed impossible to acquire any more physics data. During this time the electric field was raised to the nominal value of 500  V cm$^{-1}$, and some of the causes of the higher than expected noise levels were discerned. This is explained further in Section~\ref{All the noise}.

\section{Organisation of the data structure} \label{Organisation of the data structure} %Section - X.1
As previously noted the 35 ton consisted of three detector sub-systems: RCEs collecting TPC data, SSPs collecting photon detector data, and CRCs tagging cosmic rays. The DAQ combined these three data streams into synchronous events in time saved as LArSoft data objects called artdaq::Fragments. These data objects would later have to converted to the offline data products which the reconstruction tools developed on simulation used, this is discussed in Section~\ref{Reformatting the data to the offline structure}. This section describes the structure of the data objects in the raw form.\\

During operations the DAQ was configured to maximise data throughput and physics potential. This meant recording different lengths of times for each of the three sub-systems as the data volumes and length of physics information were significantly different. For example due to the emission of prompt light the physics information from the SSPs is of a much shorter length of time than from the RCEs where data has to be recorded whilst the electrons drift through the LAr. During the running period the recorded data was triggered by through-going muons which triggered co-incidences on the CRCs on opposites side of the cryostat. The system used to collect the CRC data was also responsible for generating the triggers and so this meant that the production of triggers could be suppressed to approximately 1 Hz by only produce triggers on the N$^{th}$ co-incidence. A trigger rate of 1 Hz was used as the maximum speed at which data could be written to disk was approximately 60 MB s$^{-1}$, which is roughly equal to the size of each triggered event when the entire detector is read-out in the configuration discussed below. The rate at which events were recorded could have been increased if zero-suppression of the TPC data had been used, however the elevated noise level meant that this was not feasible. \\ 

With an electric field of 250 V cm$^{-1}$ and a drift of 2.25 m, the drift time for electrons at the long drift CPA was roughly 2.6 ms or 5200 ticks (where 1 tick is 500 ns). It was decided that in order for a track causing a counter co-incidence to be separated from other tracks it was necessary to have roughly one drift window both before and after the drift window around the co-incidence, meaning that data was recorded for 7.5 ms or 15,000 ticks around each co-incidence. Only the prompt light from through-going particles was collected and so only XXXX $\mu$s of SSP data was recorded for each event. The CRCs produced the least volume of data and so were able to be read out constantly, though the co-incidence triggers were only produced when a trigger was issued. \\

The time synchronous events produced by the DAQ did not however correspond to the physics events, this is because the DAQ was originally designed to produce a continuous data stream. This meant that the DAQ was configured to pad events with headers when a sub-system provided no physics information. Removing these padded header objects was a further remit of the online to offline converter discussed in Section~\ref{Reformatting the data to the offline structure}. The length of the DAQ events was configurable and was chosen to be 10 ms (20,000 ticks) in order to best attempt to fully contain physics events and reduce the need for the online to offline converter to stitch DAQ events together. The padding of DAQ events with headers between physics events introduced some peculiarities in the data recorded such as DAQ events containing two parts of non-continuous data as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:DataStructure} where the second DAQ event has no information for the time between the end of physics event 2 and the start of physics event 3.\\

\end{figure}

As the run mode required accessing buffered data it had to be discretised inside the components before being sent to the event builders in the DAQ. In the discussion of how this worked focus will be given on the RCE data where some new terms need to be introduced. Data is collected for every tick on each RCE, where each RCE controls 128 channels. This is called a nanoslice. A microslice is then made by combining N nanoslices such that it contains 0.5 ms (1,000 ticks) of data across all channels. Microslices are then combined to make millislices, where a millislice is synonymous with the DAQ events discussed earlier meaning that 20 microslices are combined to make a millislice. A lack of recorded data means that microslices consist of headers in the place of nanoslices. \\

During normal data taking the last N microslices are buffered in the RCEs so that if a trigger is issued the previous millislices can be accessed before they are deleted. As the data is buffered in the form of microslices previous millislices may only be accessed in whole. This means that a whole number of millislices must be loaded before the trigger so when a trigger is issued part way through a millislice the previous X millislices are sent to the event builders. As a result during running there are always a minimum number of ticks both before (5,000 ticks) and after the trigger (9,000 ticks) but the exact numbers can change by up to 1,000 ticks for a given event depending on where in a millislice the trigger came. This is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:DataStructure} where the black lines representing triggers are seen to occur at different points within the microslices, for example physics event 1 will have more data after the trigger than physics event 2 as the trigger occurs earlier in the triggered microslice.

%********************************** %Second Section  *************************************
\section{Reformatting the data to the offline structure} \label{Reformatting the data to the offline structure} %Section - X.2
Conversion of the raw data in the form of artdaq::Fragments to LArSoft objects such as raw::RawDigits (TPC), raw::ExternalTrigger (CRC) and recob::OpDetWaveforms (SSP) required a suite of unpacking services to be written; the specifics of which are not discussed here. These all required a common interface through which to access the data, check that the timing of each component was consistent and then produce a final LArSoft file for downstream use. This interface had the added role of producing complete physics events, meaning that it had to be able to combine multiple millislices and extract only the data containing the continuous physics events. \\

The format that the data reformatter followed was that following the unpacking of each of the sub-systems the TPC ticks would be looped through to see if a user defined set of conditions could be satisfied. These conditions were usually whether an East-West or North-South counter co-incidence occurred at that time, or if the current millislice contained TPC data whilst the previous one did not. The latter was the default configuration as this gave the option of preserving all of the data gathered, for reasons discussed at the end of Section~\ref{Organisation of the data structure}. Other conditions were available though rarely used such as if the SSPs observed a large flash of flight or if there was a large change in the average TPC ADC value. Once a set of conditions is satisfied a user defined number of pre-condition ticks are gathered, clearly this is set to zero in the case of the previous millislice containing no TPC data as there is no previous data to load which would not have a gap in time, see Figure~\ref{fig:DataStructure}. In the case of using a counter co-incidence to make an event a value of 300 pre-condition ticks is normally used. Once the pre-conditions ticks are gathered a further N post-condition ticks are gathered, where N is defined by the user. Usually 15,000 ticks are gathered when the previous millislice is empty and 5,200 ticks are gathered when there is a co-incidence. Data from the other components is added to the event if its timestamp is within the timestamps of the first and last ticks in the event when no more TPC data is required from and at the end of a millislice if stitching is required. All timestamps are corrected such that the event began at T=0 as the reconstruction assumes this and the timestamp of the start of the event is stored in the event record so that it can be accessed downstream if required. \\

At all points in this process it is important to integrate flexibility so that the user can choose the length of events, which sub-systems are in the events and what the conditions are for making events. It was also important for users to be able to run the service on already formatted events as the unpacking services were the major overhead in running the interface. It is also conceivable that users would want to reformat Monte Carlo events so as to centre them around their chosen conditions and so the use of the unpacking was determined by the interface depending on the format of the input file.

\section{Observations on data quality and noise mitigation} \label{All the noise} %Section - X.3
Reformatting the online data to the offline format was an important step in maintaining data quality as subsequently there was no access to the raw data due to how the DUNE software is established. Some of the important checks which were performed are outlined in Figure~\ref{fig:DataDrops}. If any of these issues were present in a given physics event then it is discarded as the integrity of the data cannot be guaranteed. It was decided that these events would be discarded as non-synchronous events would lead to hits in the detector being at incorrect times and padding empty events with pedestals could mean that tracks seem to disappear and reappear as they travel through the detector. \\

Another example of inconsistent events is when the sub-systems are not synchronised with each other, this is normally caused by one of the sub-systems missing a clock increment from the master timing unit due to the data trigger being issued close to an increment from the master unit. This misalignment causes an incorrect time sample being read out and so the data from each sub-system within a millislice is not consistent meaning that it will fail the timestamp check and so won't be added to the event record. To avoid incomplete events the physics events are discarded when this is observed. \\

  \caption[Dropped TPC data in the 35 ton]{A diagram of how TPC microslices can be saved in millislices in the 35 ton. Two millislices are shown, each containing 10 microslices. One physics event straddling the millislice boundaries is shown and 4 RCEs representing each row are read out. The vertical blue lines delineate each microslice (0.5 ms, 1,000 ticks), with the thick blue line showing the millislice boundary. Solid red boxes represent micro slices with TPC data in them. It can be seen that RCEs 1 and 2 contain data for the same interval, whilst the data from RCE 3 in millislice 2 has been ``Dropped,'' whilst the data from RCE 4 is shifted by 1 microslice from RCEs 1 and 2 and is thus ``Inconsistent.'' As a result this physics would be discarded as data integrity cannot be guaranteed.}
  \label{fig:DataDrops}
\end{figure}

The electronic noise in the 35 ton was higher than anticipated, with the RMS of the RCE ADC being approximately 30 counts compared to an expected thermal noise of around 2.5 ADC counts. Many sources contributed to this elevated noise, some of which are explained below. \\

Though not directly affecting the noise issues stuck ADC codes were a feature of the data which had to removed downstream. Stuck ADC codes were caused by the 6 least significant bits getting frozen to either 000000 or 111111, this was observed during the first stages of commissioning and an algorithm to remove them was developed and tested on Monte Carlo by Jonathan Insler of LSU. It was observed that in simulation the signal could be recovered with minimal losses, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:StuckCodes} where the blue lines (after removal) are seen to closely match the black lines (before adding stuck codes). \\

A significant portion of the noise was correlated between groups of 32 channels, where the ADCs would coherently oscillate. To remove these coherent shifts ADC baselines were calculated for the 32 channel groups at each tick and then subtracted from the measured ADC values. This was also found to be an effective method of removing coherent noise in MicroBooNE \citep{uBooNENoise}. The effect of removing coherent noise is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:CoherentNoise}, where the signal peak becomes much easier to discern after noise removal and a coherent noise hit at tick $\sim$6030 is removed. Subtracting increases in signal at a common time across adjacent wires reduces the signal strength of events which are parallel to the APAs however as the hits from these tracks will occur at roughly the same time. The only way to prevent this is to ``protect'' potential signal regions from the coherent noise removal, as is done in MicroBooNE \citep{uBooNENoise}. \\

When a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) \citep{CoTuFFT} is performed on the coherent noise subtracted waveforms it can be seen that signals occur with specific frequencies. Some of these frequencies are caused by real energy depositions, whilst others are due to the electronics noise. It is possible to remove the noise frequencies by applying Wiener filters \citep{WienerFilter}. For each of the three planes frequency spectrum's are taken where a clear signal is both preserved and suppressed, the signal spectrum is then divided by the signal suppressed spectrum to produce a $signal/noise$ frequency space. The signal regions which want to be excluded can then be found by fitting a combination of sigmoid functions to the frequency spaces, a demonstration of how this applied is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:FrequencyFilter}. It is also possible to remove specific frequencies which are not removed by the filters, this was necessary for a 54 KHz noise component introduced by the fluorescent lights in the detector hall to be removed. After the run ended it was found that some of the high frequency noise components were introduced by a short on a warm power cable, the techniques used to find this cable will be used then commissioning future detectors \citep{35tonNoiseMeeting}. \\

Transitions to a higher noise level state were also observed after cool down. The transitions would seemingly occur at random, but were occasionally observed to happen shortly after a saturation event across the whole detector \citep{35tonNoiseMeeting}. After the transition the only way to recover the normal noise state was to power down the TPC components on APA 3, this was the only APA which did not have a ground mesh between the two sets of wire planes which may offer some clue to the cause of the effect though it could not be induced during warm testing and has not been observed in other experiments such as MicroBooNE. The elevated noise state was associated with a strong signals at high frequencies, between 400 and 650 KHz. The values of these frequencies changed during the run as shown in FigureXXXX, though once a transition at a given frequency was induced it did not change until the TPC components were powered down. Data taken during these events was unrecoverable as the noise was too large, as such upon observing a transition the TPC components were quickly power cycled. 

%********************************** % Fourth Section  *************************************
\section{Performance of reconstruction algorithms} \label{sec:DataAlgs}  %Section - X.4
Following the noise removal outlined above hit and track finding was still more difficult than in simulations due to the still elevated noise level. In order for a sensible number of hits to be reconstructed the hit finding threshold had to be substantially increased in data as compared to Monte Carlo, this meant that many of the low energy hits would not be reconstructed. \\

A potential solution to not reconstructing the low energy hits is to use the counter positions to select only hits which could have caused co-incidences. When determining whether a reconstructed hit could have caused the counter co-incidence a two-dimensional window around the counter edges in the YZ plane is constructed and timing information is used to extend this to three dimensions.  The $x$ position of the hit can be calculated using the hit time and electron drift velocity using Equation~\ref{eq:HitTime}. \\
\begin{equation} \label{eq:HitTime}
  X_{Hit} = T_{Hit} \times V_{Drift}
\end{equation}

Determining whether collection plane hits are within the counter window is trivial as they have a constant Z position and either cover the full detector height (tall APAs) or roughly half of the detector height (short APAs). The wrapping of the induction planes means that each wire segment has to be considered individually and that multiple wire segments could lie within the counter shadow. Choosing between these potential wire segments is done by iterating through the following steps. If at any point only one segment satisfies the condition then this segment is chosen:
\begin{itemize}
\item Does the wire segment intersect any collection plane wires which record hits?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item This is because when there is a signal on the collection plane there should also be signals on the induction wires.
  \end{itemize}
\item Are there adjacent wires which have hits at a similar time?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item This is because one would expect a track to deposit energy on multiple adjacent wire segments. 
  \end{itemize}
\item Which hit lies closest to the line defined by unique collection plane hits in the XZ plane?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item This is follows identical logic to the first criteria, but selects the hit which best matches the line and attempts to remove the effect of noisy collection plane wires by only using wires which have one hit within the counter shadow. This would also hopefully improve the quality of the fit as there will not be numerous outlying hits.
  \item This can be changed to consider the line defined by previously selected hits in the given TPC and plane where the hit choices are.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
DO I WANT SOME SORT OF FIGURE SHOWING THIS? LOTS OF HITS -> ONLY TRACK HITS? COL HITS USED IN ITEM 3, OVERLAYED WITH ALL INDUCTION PLANE HITS CONSIDERED, WITH THE ONES KEPT IN A DIFFERENT COLOUR? \\

Following a re-optimisation of the clustering algorithms it was observed that the standard reconstruction could achieve track reconstruction to a similar efficiency as the counter shadowing and so the standard reconstruction has been used in the discussions to follow \citep{TingjunClustering}. There has since been an effort to improve the counter shadowing hit disambiguation to remove the outlying collection plane hits using the MLESAC method \citep{MLESAC} whereby points which are far away from a best fit are ignored, these studies are still on-going.\\

%****** Now to talk about the reconstruction efficiencies... ******%
A symptom of the elevated noise state is that signals are often dropped on one of the induction planes, this means that the tracking algorithms often have to combine clusters in only two of the three planes. Reconstruction using two planes was shown to be effective by the ArgoNeuT collaboration \citep{ArgoNeuT} so the loss of signal in one of the three planes is not prohibitive to track reconstruction. Another consequence of the elevated noise level is that even when the counters are used to seed hit finding the hit finding threshold is too high to reconstruct the very lowest hits. This causes the plot of $dQ/dx$ for muons, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:TingjunLifetime}, to look flat due to a cutoff at 100 ADC cm$^{-1}$ below which no hits are found. The inability to reconstruct the lowest energy hits means that calorimetry is all but impossible on the 35 ton dataset even though the tracking algorithms perform relatively well. \\

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{TingjunLifetime}
  \caption[$dQ/dx$ in the 35 ton as a function of drift time]
          {The $dQ/dx$ values for a sample of muon collection plane hits \citep{TingjunLifetime}, note the cutoff at 100 ADC cm$^{-1}$ due to the hit finding threshold.}
  \label{fig:TingjunLifetime}
\end{figure}  

The inability to perform reliable calorimetry en masse means that the only particles which can be assuredly identified are the muons which triggered the counter co-incidences, making the analysis proposed in !!FIXME!!Section~ref{PIDAnalysis}!!FIXME!! extremely difficult if not impossible. The muons in this sample will all traverse the detector but their orientations can be carefully selected by the user, for example one could easily select a sample of muons which cross the APAs at increasing angles, or are parallel to the wire planes at increasing drift distances. A reconstructed track is assigned to a given counter co-incidence if the dot product of the track and the co-incidence is more than 0.98 and the hit times are consistent with the $x$ positions of the counters, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:CounterCoincidence}. This should result in a pure sample of tracks as parallel muons are unlikely to be highly correlated in time and any tracks reconstructed from the noise will have random directions and so will not pass the dot product cut. This is shown in data where if multiple tracks pass the dot product cut they are co-linear and are not randomly orientated, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:CounterTrackAngle}. \\

  \label{fig:CounterTrackAngle}
\end{figure}

By matching tracks in this way it possible to evaluate the reconstruction efficiencies for these muons at increasing drift distances and track angles. If multiple tracks are aligned with the coincidence and are within the expected time region then their track lengths are summed when calculating reconstruction efficiencies as it is expected that the track was split by a region of the detector either being turned off or too noisy to reliably reconstruct a track. A minimum reconstructed length of 50 cm is used to determine if the track was partially reconstructed as above this length the track is likely to have been stitched between TPCs, the verification of which was a design goal of the 35 ton. A reconstructed track that is 50 cm long is also likely to have a large number of hits on collection plane wires that are not noisy, these hits are needed when calculating purity or measuring the effect of diffusion as discussed in Section~\ref{DiffusionAnalysis}. \\

From Figure~\ref{fig:DataRecoEffics} it is evident that the reconstruction efficiency for tracks with shallow angles relative to the APAs is extremely poor, with the efficiency for tracks with angles less than 8$^{\circ}$ never rising above 10\%. This is due to the coherent noise removal where hits which are correlated in time will be removed as they will be perceived as being noise as opposed to real signals. When considering tracks with angles in the 12$^{\circ}$ to 20$^{\circ}$ range the reconstruction is seen to be perform reasonably well for tracks whose centres are less than 140 cm away from the APAs, before decreasing for tracks which have a longer drift distance. A decrease in reconstruction efficiency for tracks which at large drift distances is due to the hits being below threshold and so not being reconstructed. It should be noted that in order to observe a drift distance effect on reconstruction efficiency the distance plotted is the average $x$ position of the counters, so a track going from 10 cm to 230 cm will have an average $x$ position of 120 cm (assuming a straight trajectory) as shown by the point for Counter difference 7 in Figure~\ref{fig:DistanceCanvas} with $\sim$23\% efficiency. \\

\section{Measuring interaction times using electron diffusion}  \label{DiffusionAnalysis}%Section - X.5
As electrons drift from the interaction point to the wire planes they become spread out in both time and space, this effect is known as diffusion and is an important property of electron transport in LAr which must be well understood. The mechanism by which diffusion occurs in LAr was first discussed by Atrazhev-Timoshkin~\citep{Atrazhev-Timoshkin}, and has since been developed to consist of a complete set of measurements for electric fields between 100 and 2000 V cm$^{-1}$~\citep{Li:2015rqa}. The diffusion of electrons is rarely isotropic and so the components that are in the transverse direction to the drift field and the component that is in the drift field direction are measured separately. Diffusion in the drift direction is called longitudinal diffusion and is generally smaller than the transverse diffusion. Figure~\ref{fig:DomDiffSchem} shows how diffusion can smear the electrons collected on a set of wires when the electrons are initially highly correlated in time and space. \\

  \caption[Schematic showing the process of diffusion]{A schematic showing the difference between longitudinal diffusion (left) and transverse diffusion (right). In both cases four electrons are initially shown below four wires, a thermal wiggle is then applied in the direction of drift and perpendicular to the drift direction in the longitudinal and transverse cases respectively. It can be seen that the effect of the thermal wiggles is to make the electrons spread out in time in the case of longitudinal diffusion and to spread out in space in the case of transverse diffusion\citep{DomSeptMeeting}.}

Longitudinal diffusion has the effect of spreading the drifting electrons out in time causing signals to become wider in time and smaller in height as the total charge is conserved. The increasing hit width can be measured for increasing drift times (distances) provided the hits do not fall below a hit finding threshold. Transverse diffusion causes drifting electrons to spread out in space changing the amount of charge deposited on a wire and reducing the charge resolution of the detector. Transverse diffusion is measured by discerning how the width of the hit charge distribution changes for increasing drift distances~\citep{DomSeptMeeting}. \\

Through-going particles make ideal tracks to study diffusion as they are minimally ionising and so have roughly constant energy depositions along their tracks. The tracks they produce can also cover a wide range of drift distances if they are not parallel to the APAs. The drift distances of hits within a track can be determined by matching the track with a counter coincidence as discussed at the end of Section~\ref{sec:DataAlgs} and then correcting the $x$ co-ordinates of the hits using Equation~\ref{eq:HitTime} where $T_{Hit} = T_{Measured} - T_{Interaction}$. \\

Traditionally the only way to determine an interaction time for a track is to match it to either an external calibration source such as whether it aligns with an external counter coincidence, or to match it to a flash of scintillation light. These techniques are particularly crucial for neutrino detectors on the Earths surface such as MicroBooNE where each neutrino interaction has a background of many cosmic muons which need to be disentangled in order correctly assign a scintillation flash to a reconstructed track. An example of an event which has many scintillation flashes and cosmic muons which need to be correctly associated is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:DiffLotsOfFlashes}. However it may be possible that the change in hit width due to diffusion as a particle travels through the detector could be used to determine the interaction time, though this has not been attempted before. To study whether this is possible the effects of diffusion would have to be measured for a sample of tracks with known interaction times and orientations. \\

\begin{figure}[h!]

\end{figure}

The 35 ton dataset is ideal for testing this hypothesis as the counters are able to provide a sample with known track angles and interaction times which can be used to tune an interaction time determination metric. This metric can then be applied to another sample of tracks where the interaction time is known but not used so that the accuracy of the calculated interaction times can be found. As longitudinal diffusion is the dominant effect that increases the hit width transverse diffusion will not be directly considered further. \\

When calculating the determination metrics only hits on wires which are not on wires with high noise want to be considered. This is because wires with a high level of correlated noise observe hits with a wider RMS as shown by Figure~\ref{fig:DomsHitModel} where a baseline noise of 10 ADC counts was added to a simulated hit with a peak value of 50 ADC counts and RMS 10 ticks. Hits with delta rays also need to be removed as the deposited energy will be larger and over a longer period of time than hits from the main track, this will make the RMS of the individual hit wider and also increase the width of the charge distribution for the track. In order to remove these hits only hits which satisfy the following cuts are used:
\begin{itemize}
\item No hit on the same wire within 50 ticks of the hit in question - removes delta rays.
\item No more than XXXX (10) hits on the same wire in the whole 15,000 tick data sample - removes noisy wires.
\end{itemize}
A further restriction applied to the hits is that only collection plane hits are used as the charge resolution is better and the signals are unipolar as opposed to bipolar meaning that a Gaussian can be easily fitted to the signals. Additionally the $signal/noise$ ratio on the collection planes was much higher than on the induction planes for the 35 ton dataset and so the hits could be much more reliably reconstructed. \\

Diffusion is a track angle dependent property and so track angle ranges have to be considered independently. From Figure~\ref{fig:DataRecoEffics} it can be seen that tracks with a counter difference of 4 are the best reconstructed in data and so reference will be given to these tracks, though the same procedure is applied to all track angles. The tracks are considered en masse and so the hits for every track are separated into 10 cm regions of increasing drift distance from the APAs. The following quantities are calculated for each 10 cm region:
\begin{itemize}
\item The $RMS$ of the hit - the most direct way to measure transverse diffusion.
\item The $RMS/charge$ of the hit - an attempt to remove the angular dependence and to incorporate an extra drift distance dependence on impurities for relatively low purity data.
\end{itemize}
Fitting Gaussian's around the peaks of the distributions will yield the most probable values for the drift regions, as is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:DiffDataHitFit}. \\
